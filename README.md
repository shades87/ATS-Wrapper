This web ui was created on windows in VS Code

This frontend requires Svelte, Node JS and Skeleton UI
Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager
Svelte and Skeleton should be installed by runnning the command npm i

This frontend wrapper is designed to connect to the backend here: https://github.com/shades87/ATS
The backend has it's own requirements and should be started before the frontend is started.

Start this frontend with the command npm run dev

Once started you should be able to open it in any web browser in the address http://localhost:5173/

The backend requires environment variables for Gemini and Chat GPT
For marking purposes I'm happy to provide those variables, please send an email from your @curtin email to daniel.m.mcfadyen@gmail.com

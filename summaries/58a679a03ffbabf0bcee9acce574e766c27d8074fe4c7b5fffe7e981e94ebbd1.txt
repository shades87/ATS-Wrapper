7-Eleven is expanding the availability of the fan-favorite item, the taquito, to two more states in the United States - Arizona and Colorado. The convenience store chain originally introduced the taquito in Texas and California but has now decided to bring it to more locations due to its popularity. This move is part of 7-Eleven's efforts to offer a wider range of fresh and convenient food options to customers.

A climate activist in Australia has been sentenced to three months in jail for participating in a protest that blocked a coal terminal at the Port of Newcastle. The activist was found guilty of obstructing a roadway during the protest, which aimed to draw attention to the impact of coal on climate change. The court stated that while peaceful protest was a democratic right, it should not disrupt the lawful activities of others. The activist's sentence sparked debate among supporters who view it as a harsh punishment for standing up against fossil fuel industries.

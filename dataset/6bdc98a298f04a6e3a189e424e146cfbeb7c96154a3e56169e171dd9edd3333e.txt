article:Palestinian health officials overnight reported the first case of polio in an unvaccinated 10-month-old child in the Gaza city of Deir al-Balah, the first case in years in the coastal enclave that has been engulfed in the Israel-Hamas war since October 7.After discovering the child's symptoms, tests were conducted in Jordan's capital of Amman and the case was confirmed to be polio, said the ministry.The potentially fatal, paralysing disease mostly strikes children under age five and typically spreads through contaminated water. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries where the spread of polio has never been stopped.The World Health Organization did not immediately respond to requests to confirm the case. However, UN health and children's agencies have called for seven-day pauses in the fighting, starting at the end of August, to vaccinate 640,000 Palestinian children against polio.They said the polio virus had been discovered in wastewater in two major cities last month in Gaza, which has been polio free for the last 25 years, according to the United Nations.ADVERTISEMENTThe humanitarian community has warned of the re-emergence of polio since the latest war erupted when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing around 1200 people and taking more than 250 hostage.A Palestinian girl weeps on a truck as she evacuates a school that had been her shelter, in eastern Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip. (Source: Associated Press)Israel's devastating retaliatory offensive has killed more than 40,000 people in Gaza in the 10-month-long conflict and created a dire humanitarian situation, which health officials say has created a public health emergency.In July, the World Health Organization said a variant of type two was discovered in wastewater samples from southern Khan Younis and central Deir al-Balah, and linked to a variant of the polio virus last detected in Egypt in 2023.While WHO did not confirm the polio case, it said earlier that three children in Gaza were found with acute flaccid paralysis â€” the onset of weakness or paralysis with reduced muscle tone, a common symptom of polio.The children's stool samples have been sent for testing to the Jordan National Polio Laboratory, it said.The WHO said more than 1.6 million doses of the polio vaccine are expected to arrive in Gaza by the end of August, in time for the vaccination campaigns, which would have to be conducted in two rounds.ADVERTISEMENTChildren under 10 will be given two drops of the oral vaccine against type two of the polio virus.Health officials in Gaza said they won't be able to stop the spread and treat people without an urgent ceasefire in place.Meanwhile, international mediators expressed hope that a ceasefire deal is within reach. They said two days of talks had wrapped up in Qatar and that they plan to reconvene in Cairo next week to seal an agreement to stop the fighting.The mediators have spent months trying to hammer out a three-phase plan in which Hamas would release the hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
summary:The first case of polio in years has been confirmed in an unvaccinated child in Gaza. The disease mostly affects children under five and spreads through contaminated water. Health officials are urging a ceasefire to vaccinate 640,000 Palestinian children. The conflict in Gaza has created a dire health crisis, making it crucial to stop the fighting to prevent the spread of polio. International mediators are working on a plan to bring about peace and address the escalating crisis.

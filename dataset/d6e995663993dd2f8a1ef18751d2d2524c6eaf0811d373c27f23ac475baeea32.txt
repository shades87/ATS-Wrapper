It's really good preparation for next week."I think I'd rather play, and whether it's good or bad this week, to be on that momentum of competitively playing and I know I get a good three weeks off after the Open."After failing to record a top-10 finish in more than four months, Ko now has a little momentum on her side, finishing tied for eighth at the CPKC Women's Open in Canada last month, before her Paris triumph.
summary:Lydia Ko, the Olympic champion and newly inducted LPGA Hall of Famer, is making waves at the Scottish Open in Ayrshire, sitting just two shots behind the leaders. Despite tough weather conditions, Ko managed to match her strong opening round performance, showcasing her skill with four birdies. Taking part in the Scottish Open as a preparatory step for the upcoming British Open at St Andrews, Ko is aiming to maintain her competitive momentum following her recent victory in Paris. This strategic decision to play on a links-style course like the one in Scotland sets her up for success on similar terrains and keeps her in the groove before her well-deserved break after the Open.

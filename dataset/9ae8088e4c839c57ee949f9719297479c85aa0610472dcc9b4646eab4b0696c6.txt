article:A COVID-era ban on standing outside a pub while drinking alcohol will be scrapped in NSW. This will allow people to stand up while drinking alcohol on a footpath in front of a venue.The NSW Government described the current ban as “useless” and hoped dumping it will help revive nightlife across the state.NSW Night-time Economy Minister John Graham said: “A blanket ban on standing with a drink in hand is a red tape hangover that has no place in 2024.”“Useless” banNSW Premier Chris Minns described the existing rule on seated-only drinking in outdoor venues as “useless”.He added: “Having an economy that fires up at 5pm during the week is critical for global cities like Sydney.”Shadow Arts Minister Kevin Anderson welcomed the changes. However, he urged the Government to ensure “no extra costs will be passed onto small business or consumers as a result of these changes”.Nightlife revivalLast December, the State Government passed laws designed to “boost NSW’s night economy”.It included turning extended outdoor dining areas, like footpaths or parking spaces outside a restaurant or bar, from temporary to permanent.Venues offering live music are able to stay open for an extra two hours under these laws.The outdoor standing rules will be included in a broader set of nightlife reforms, yet to be tabled in Parliament.
summary:Effective July 1st, New South Wales will lift the ban on standing while drinking outside pubs to breathe new life into nighttime activities. The current prohibition has been criticized as unnecessary and will be abolished to revitalize the state's evening economy. The government aims to promote a more vibrant and dynamic nightlife scene by allowing patrons to stand with a drink in hand, an outdated restriction that no longer fits the times. This change is part of broader efforts to enhance the nighttime experience, complemented by measures such as extending outdoor dining areas permanently and granting additional hours for venues featuring live music. The announcement has drawn support, with a call for transparency on potential cost implications for businesses and consumers. These revisions are expected to be part of a comprehensive set of reforms to be presented in Parliament soon.

article:Bombshell news has dropped over injured Melbourne superstar Christian Petracca and his future at the Demons. The 28-year-old Petracca is recovering from the horrific injuries he suffered in the King\’s Birthday clash against Collingwood back in June that were “likened to a car crash”. Petracca was crunched by Collingwood\’s Darcy Moore in a marking contest in the first quarter and was left with four broken ribs, a lacerated spleen and a small puncture in a lung, requiring emergency surgery to stop the bleeding. During the midfielder\’s absence, the Demons have slipped from likely AFL finalists and potential flag contenders to 13th on the ladder with a 10-11 record and highly unlikely to feature in September.Now alleged uncertainties over the direction of the club have prompted Petracca to consider seeking a trade, according the Channel 9\’s Tom Morris. “Christian Petracca is disgruntled and particularly disillusioned with the club\’s direction,” Morris reported on Monday evening. “Petracca\’s a pro, he\’s desperate for another flag, but he has become increasingly unhappy in the wake of his season-ending spleen injury. “His disenchantment — which is not directed at the coach (Simon Goodwin), it must be said — has now become so palpable that if he was out of contract, the four-time All-Australian would likely ask for a trade tomorrow. “But the reality is he has five years left on his contract and it\’s basically impossible to see how the Dees would agree to let their best player go, even if he did demand a trade.” Speaking on Fox Footy\’s On the Couch, Melbourne great Garry Lyon was taken aback by the report before offering a measured, albeit passionate, response. “I\’d need to hear that from Christian. It\’s the first I\’ve heard of it,” he said. “I\’m not troubled by it until I hear it from Christian, OK? “If I could eyeball Christian Petracca and say \’you signed a seven-year deal for $1.2 (million), they\’ve taken you to the promised land, they\’ve set you up for life and now you want to get out?\’ Then I\’d be troubled.” Petracca required multiple surgeries to recover from his injuries, following the move to allow the premiership winner to go back onto the ground after the collision. His family and Melbourne fans were left frustrated by the handling of the incident, with a grey looking Petracca clearly in major distress when he returned to the field, although he later took responsibility for that decision. Not surprisingly, Morris said a rival club is already monitoring the situation surrounding the top-rated talent. “For now teammates are aware of his frustrations, some even share them, key officials are aware too, but standing firm he will not be traded under any circumstances,” Morris added. “One rival club also understands how unsettled Petracca is and they\’re watching the situation closely.”
summary:Melbourne football star Christian Petracca has been dealing with severe injuries after a game against Collingwood, but now there are rumors swirling about his future with the Demons. Despite having several years left on his contract, reports suggest that Petracca is unhappy with the club's direction and may consider requesting a trade. However, Melbourne is unlikely to let go of their best player, even if he asks. While these rumors are causing a stir, it's crucial to hear directly from Petracca himself before jumping to conclusions. The situation has caught the attention of rival clubs, who are closely monitoring the developments. It's a tense situation with a lot at stake for both Petracca and Melbourne fans.

article:Trump made $300k from selling bibles - but owes $100mGetty Images Trump holds a Bible in Washington in 2020Former US President Donald Trump is making money from branded bibles and cryptocurrency holdings. But he also owes more than $100m (£91m) in liabilities from three lawsuits he has lost, according to new financial disclosure forms released on Thursday. Federal candidates are required to file disclosures each year detailing their income, investments, assets and liabilities. While the former president lists over 150 pages of assets, his liabilities add up to tens of millions owed for the legal troubles he's faced this year.Trump has made $300,000 (£273,000) from branded bibles, listed on the financial disclosure form as "The Greenwood Bible". The former president started selling the books earlier this year after partnering with country music singer Lee Greenwood. Mr Greenwood is known for his song God Bless the USA, which inspired the name of the bible: God Bless the USA Bible. They are for sale on Mr Greenwood's website for $59.99. Trump also earned income from sales of several of his own books. He earned $4.5m in royalties from Letters to Trump - which features letters between Trump and celebrities - and $500,000 from A MAGA Journey. The form also lists Trump holding between $1m and $5m in cryptocurrency, which the former president once called "a scam". He has since reversed his stance and recently embraced the digital currency at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. "Bitcoin is not threatening the dollar," he said. "The behaviour of the current US government is really threatening the dollar."
summary:Former US President Donald Trump made $300,000 from selling branded bibles and holds between $1 million and $5 million in cryptocurrency. He owes over $100 million in liabilities from legal troubles. Trump also earned from royalties of his books, including "Letters to Trump" and "A MAGA Journey". Despite calling cryptocurrency a scam in the past, he now supports it and believes it is not a threat to the US dollar.

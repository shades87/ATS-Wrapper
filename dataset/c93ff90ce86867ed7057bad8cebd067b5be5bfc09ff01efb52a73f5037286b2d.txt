article:This popular Japanese item is popping up in more 7-Eleven stores than ever before — and Aussies are hoping it\’s a sign of more things to come. A social media user took to Reddit to express their excitement at finding teriyaki chicken onigiri at a 7-Eleven store. “Japanese food starting to pop up at 7/11 since the Japanese 7/11 buyout,” they captioned the image. Others were over the moon at the discovery. “This is the best news I\’ve heard in a while. Japanese 7/11 is incredible,” one commented. Onigiri is now available in more 7-Eleven stores. Another said, “These are delicious.” However, it turns out it has nothing to do with new 7-Eleven Australia being purchased by 7-Eleven International. Onigiri has been a staple of 7-Eleven stores in Victoria for years, and the popular item has now made its way up the east coast. “Our 7-Eleven Onigiri, like our other sushi, is delivered fresh daily,” a 7-Eleven spokesperson told news.com.au. “The onigiri are $3.70 and are available in three flavours Cooked Spicy Tuna, Chicken Teriyaki or Sweet Chilli Salmon. They have been available in Victoria for quite a few years, and launched in New South Wales and Queensland (other than Cairns and Townsville) over the last few months.” 7-Eleven International LLC announced in April that it had successfully acquired 7-Eleven Australia, adding 750 stores to its network. Aussies are hoping it means more Japanese products. Many speculated the takeover would transform the convenience store\’s food offerings, with social media users hoping it would take notes from the Japanese version of the chain. “Bring on the little pancakes in a packet,” one social media user pleaded. Another added, “I\’m so happy, I hope Japan purges the Australian market of bland food.” The 7-Eleven spokesperson said the Australian chain had a “long-term focus on our food offerings”. “Now as part of the 7-Eleven International network we are looking forward to working more closely with our international counterparts to grow our food offer,” they said. “Without question, 7-Eleven Japan has one of the best food offers in convenience in the world, so their expertise is going to be invaluable in helping to set a new benchmark for food here in Australia.”
summary:7-Eleven in Australia is now offering delicious Japanese onigiri, much to the delight of customers. This popular item, available in flavors like Cooked Spicy Tuna and Chicken Teriyaki, has been a hit in Victoria for years and is now expanding up the east coast. The recent acquisition of 7-Eleven Australia by 7-Eleven International is sparking hopes for more Japanese products in stores. The chain aims to enhance its food offerings with the expertise of its Japanese counterparts, known for their top-notch convenience store food. Customers can look forward to exciting new options and improved food quality at 7-Eleven stores in Australia.

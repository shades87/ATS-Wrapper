article:At least 19 people have died during student-led protests in Bangladesh. Anti-government rallies have caused chaos in parts of the country’s capital Dhaka, as students call for a jobs quota system to be scrapped. Under the system, more than 30% of public service jobs in Bangladesh are reserved for families of veterans who served in the country’s war of independence. Protesters, who have been gathering at university campuses, have called the quotas “discriminatory”. In 1971, East and West Pakistan fought in a war that ended with the creation of an independent Bangladesh. Shortly after independence, then-leader Sheikh Mujibur Rehman introduced a quota system for public service jobs — around one in three roles were reserved for soldiers who served in the Bangladesh independence war, and their relatives. The quota system was in place until 2018, when similar protests led to its suspension. The country’s High Court reinstated it last month. This month, tens of thousands of students have led protests calling for an end to the public service quota. Protesters are calling for the system to be overhauled, so staff are appointed to public service roles based on merit, not heritage. Student-led blockades and protests have spread across several cities in Bangladesh, including Chattogram and Rangpur. Demonstrators have blocked roads in the capital, Dhaka, prompting an escalation of violence and clashes with security officials. Riot police have been deployed to shut down protests. Footage shows police using tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds. Internet and mobile services have been cut off in some parts of the country. Clashes between police and students killed at least 19 people. Some media reports estimate the death toll is higher. Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina has condemned the violence. In a televised address, she announced there would be a “judicial investigation” into the protest and incidents of violence. She also said the country’s top court, the Supreme Court, is weighing up the future of the quota system and is expected to hand down a decision next month. United Nations Human Rights chief, Volker Türk, has urged Bangladesh officials to engage with protesters. “Freedom of expression & peaceful assembly are fundamental human rights,” he posted on X. The U.S. Embassy in Dhaka has temporarily closed to the public due to security concerns. Australia has updated its travel advice to “exercise a high degree of caution” for Bangladesh, citing widespread unrest.
summary:Violent protests led by students in Bangladesh have caused chaos and resulted in multiple deaths. The protests are against a jobs quota system that reserves public service roles for families of veterans. The government initially suspended the system in 2018 due to similar protests but reinstated it last month, sparking fresh demonstrations. The protests aim for merit-based rather than heritage-based appointments. The unrest has led to clashes with police, with reports of casualties. The Prime Minister has promised a judicial investigation, and the Supreme Court will decide on the quota system next month. The UN and the US have called for dialogue with protesters, while Australia has advised caution for travelers in Bangladesh due to the ongoing unrest.

At least six flights leaving Sydney this morning have been cancelled so far across Virgin, Jetstar and Qantas, with a further nine flights headed into Sydney scrapped.

"Due to high winds Airservices Australia will continue to operate our east-west runway, which may cause some delays throughout the day. This will remain in place into the afternoon," the spokesperson said.

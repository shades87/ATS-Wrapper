article:There has been a breakthrough in an intriguing case A Current Affair reported on last month. Sydney man Andre Azar said his trust was abused after his vehicle was allegedly stolen in an online car sale gone wrong. The Azars wanted a quick sale, so they listed it for $5000 to $6000 less than market value and were contacted within hours by prospective buyers. That night the prospective buyers, a young couple, were welcomed into the Azar family home, in Sydney\’s south west. They told Andre their names and they even showed him NSW Government issued photo IDs. What followed was a hard-luck story that resulted in a cheque deposited into Azar\’s account and his vehicle registered to another owner despite there being no paperwork. But A Current Affair was there when police came knocking.
summary:A recent development has occurred in an interesting case previously covered by A Current Affair. A man, Andre Azar, found himself in a troublesome situation when his car was purportedly stolen during an online car sale that went awry. The Azar family aimed for a swift sale and priced their vehicle significantly below market value, attracting potential buyers swiftly. Following a visit to their home by a young couple who presented official photo IDs, a series of events unfolded, resulting in a deposited cheque and the car being registered to a different owner without proper paperwork. Subsequently, police intervention ensued, which was captured by A Current Affair.

article:There has been a breakthrough in an intriguing case A Current Affair reported on last month. Sydney man Andre Azar said his trust was abused after his vehicle was allegedly stolen in an online car sale gone wrong. The Azars wanted a quick sale, so they listed it for $5000 to $6000 less than market value and were contacted within hours by prospective buyers. That night the prospective buyers, a young couple, were welcomed into the Azar family home, in Sydney\’s south west. They told Andre their names and they even showed him NSW Government issued photo IDs. What followed was a hard-luck story that resulted in a cheque deposited into Azar\’s account and his vehicle registered to another owner despite there being no paperwork. But A Current Affair was there when police came knocking.
summary:There has been a significant development in a recent case featured on A Current Affair in Sydney. Andre Azar shared how his trust was taken advantage of when his car was apparently stolen during an online sale gone awry. The Azars aimed for a quick sale, listing the vehicle below its market value, leading to a prompt response from potential buyers. The buyers, a young couple, visited the Azar household that very night, providing seemingly legitimate identification. Despite their heart-wrenching tale, a check was deposited in Azar's account, and the vehicle was transferred to another owner without proper paperwork. Police intervened with a visit during A Current Affair's coverage of the situation.

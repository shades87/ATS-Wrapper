summary:Former President Donald Trump's campaign plane, dubbed 'Trump Force Two,' experienced an emergency landing recently during a trip to a rally in Montana due to a malfunction. The incident occurred as Ohio senator and Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance was traveling on the plane with his wife, dog, campaign staff, and reporters. The pilot declared an emergency after spotting a door seal problem shortly after take-off from Milwaukee, prompting the plane to return for repairs. The aircraft eventually resumed its journey to Cincinnati, where Vance resides. Despite the unexpected turn of events, the situation was swiftly resolved, and the flight was able to continue as planned. In another incident, Trump's plane had a minor collision with a parked jet in Florida earlier this year, highlighting the unpredictability of air travel, even for high-profile figures.

summary:A ban in New South Wales that prohibited standing while drinking alcohol outside pubs will be lifted, allowing individuals to enjoy a drink while standing on footpaths. The NSW Government sees this change as a way to revitalize nightlife. The Premier and the Night-time Economy Minister both criticized the existing rule, calling it outdated and hindering the city's dynamic evening economy. Changes in laws last year aimed to enhance the night scene, making outdoor dining areas permanent and extending hours for venues with live music. These new standing rules are part of a larger set of reforms yet to be presented to Parliament.

article:Travellers at Sydney Airport are being urged to expect further delays as strong winds continue to batter the city this morning. A cold front moving across Australia\’s south-east has brought harsh winds of 100km/h, rain and even blizzard conditions to parts of Victoria and New South Wales.

At least six flights leaving Sydney this morning have been cancelled so far across Virgin, Jetstar and Qantas, with a further nine flights headed into Sydney scrapped.

"Due to high winds Airservices Australia will continue to operate our east-west runway, which may cause some delays throughout the day. This will remain in place into the afternoon," the spokesperson said.

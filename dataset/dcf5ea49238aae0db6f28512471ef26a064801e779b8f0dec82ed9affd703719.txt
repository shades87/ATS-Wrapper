article:Cancelling show over Gaza remarks an 'error': OrchestraThe MSO subsequently removed the British-Australian pianist from an upcoming concert on Thursday, saying he put them in a "difficult situation".Before starting the recital, Mr Gillham said Israel had killed more than 100 Palestinian journalists.On Sunday, Jayson Gillham premiered a five-minute piece called Witness, written by composer Connor D’Netto, which was dedicated to the journalists of Gaza.The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (MSO) has admitted it made an "error" in cancelling an acclaimed pianist’s performance due to comments he made on the Israel-Gaza war.Now the entire concert, due to be held at Melbourne Town Hall, has been cancelled due to safety concerns.The MSO says they are trying to reschedule the performance.At Sunday’s concert, which was held at the Iwaki Auditorium in Melbourne, Jayson Gillham performed a range of other works, from Beethoven to Chopin.Witness was a last-minute addition, according to the MSO."The killing of journalists is a war crime in international law, and it is done in an effort to prevent the documentation and broadcasting of war crimes to the world," Mr Gillham claimed before starting to play Witness.In an apologetic statement on Thursday, the MSO said “While the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra maintains that a concert platform is not an appropriate stage for political comment, we acknowledge Jayson’s concerns for those in the Middle East and elsewhere."“We recognise the strength of feelings of all parties on this matter and particularly acknowledge the dedication and commitment demonstrated by all our musicians and staff this week.”Mr Gillham has accepted the MSO’s apology.“I hold my relationship with the MSO, its players and audience with the highest regard and look forward to our continued working relationship in years to come,” he said in a statement.Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.That attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive on Gaza and the current war.Nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.At least 113 of those were journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an independent organisation that promotes press freedom.The decision by the MSO and their subsequent apology have caused a stir on social media. High profile barrister Greg Barns said the cancellation was “truly appalling,” later adding that “art is often powerful because it’s political”.Arts critic and former Sydney Symphony Orchestra chairman Leo Schofield said of the MSO’s apology, “Not before time. How I wish Gillham was giving a concert in Sydney. He would get a standing ovation here from supporters who admire his courage almost as much as they admire his talent.”The Israel-Gaza war has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all sides have sought to carefully manage.As has been the case in countless other countries, there have been protests from both Jewish and Muslim communities, as well as sharp upticks in Islamophobia and anti-semitism.
summary:The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra's decision to cancel a performance by acclaimed pianist Jayson Gillham due to comments made about the Israel-Gaza conflict has caused quite a stir. Despite the cancellation, Gillham continued to highlight the importance of freedom of speech and dedicated a piece to journalists in Gaza. The MSO later recognized their mistake and apologized, while also acknowledging the sensitivity of the issue. The incident has sparked discussions on social media, with many expressing support for Gillham's actions and criticizing the cancellation. The conflict between Israel and Gaza has also stirred political tensions in Australia, showcasing the need for careful management to prevent further division.

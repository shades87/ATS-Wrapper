Ko decided to play in the tournament to prepare for the upcoming British Open at St Andrews, despite initial hesitation due to her recent emotional victory. She believes playing on these unique links-style courses in Scotland will help her game. After some challenging months, Ko is starting to regain her momentum with recent top-10 finishes.

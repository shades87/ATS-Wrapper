article:There has been a breakthrough in an intriguing case A Current Affair reported on last month. Sydney man Andre Azar said his trust was abused after his vehicle was allegedly stolen in an online car sale gone wrong. The Azars wanted a quick sale, so they listed it for $5000 to $6000 less than market value and were contacted within hours by prospective buyers. That night the prospective buyers, a young couple, were welcomed into the Azar family home, in Sydney\’s south west. They told Andre their names and they even showed him NSW Government issued photo IDs. What followed was a hard-luck story that resulted in a cheque deposited into Azar\’s account and his vehicle registered to another owner despite there being no paperwork. But A Current Affair was there when police came knocking.
summary:A recent development has occurred in a case discussed by A Current Affair involving Andre Azar from Sydney, whose trust was taken advantage of in an online car sale incident. Facing a quick sale, Azar listed his car at a lower price and quickly found interested buyers. The buyers, a young couple, visited Azar's home, shared their identities and a sorry tale, leading to a check being deposited into Azar's account and his car being registered to someone else without proper documentation. Stay tuned for updates on this fascinating case.

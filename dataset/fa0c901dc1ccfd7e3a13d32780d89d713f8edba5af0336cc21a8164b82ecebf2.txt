article:Travellers at Sydney Airport are being urged to expect further delays as strong winds continue to batter the city this morning. A cold front moving across Australia\’s south-east has brought harsh winds of 100km/h, rain and even blizzard conditions to parts of Victoria and New South Wales. Sydney Airport is continuing to operate only a single runway as strong winds of up to 50km/h are expected. At least six flights leaving Sydney this morning have been cancelled so far across Virgin, Jetstar and Qantas, with a further nine flights headed into Sydney scrapped.

"Due to high winds Airservices Australia will continue to operate our east-west runway, which may cause some delays throughout the day. This will remain in place into the afternoon," the spokesperson said.

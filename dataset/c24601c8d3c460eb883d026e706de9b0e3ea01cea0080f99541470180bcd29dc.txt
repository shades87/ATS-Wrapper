article:A trail of destruction lies in the path that Ukrainian forces carved on their risky incursion into Russia, blasting through the border and eventually into the town of Sudzha, where Associated Press journalists travelled on a Ukrainian government-organised trip.Artillery fire has blown chunks out of a statue of Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin that stands in a central square of the Russian town, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said was fully under his troops' control.The windows of an administrative building are blasted out, and its bright yellow facade is scorched and pockmarked with bullet holes.Ukrainian forces have overrun one Russian settlement after another in the surprise operation that Kyiv hopes will change the dynamic of the conflict.Local residents hide in a basement in Sudzha, Kursk region (Source: Associated Press)ADVERTISEMENTRussia's military has so far struggled to mount an effective response to the attack on its Kursk region, the largest on the country since World War II.Sudzha, which is 10 kilometres from the border, is the biggest town to fall to Ukraine's troops since the incursion began August 6.Evidence of Ukraine's lightning march lines the roads to the town. On grass littered with debris lies a sign blasted with bullets that has arrows in two directions: Ukraine to the left and Russia to right.

(Source: Associated Press)The incursion has reframed the conflict, leading to the evacuation of more than 120,000 civilians, according to Russian authorities, and the capture of at least 100 Russian troops, according to Kyiv.It is widely seen as a major morale boost for a country and an army struggling to fend off steady Russian advances more than two years after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine.ADVERTISEMENTBut, so far, it has not dented Russia's overall strategic advantage.A destroyed Russian tank lies on a roadside near Sudzha, Kursk region. (Source: Associated Press)The full scope of the Kursk operation remains unclear, including how long Ukraine is willing to hold Russian territory and to what end.Will Sudzha be a bargaining chip for a future ceasefire negotiation?And if so, will Ukraine assume the role of an occupier in a country that, in turn, controls a fifth of its own territory?Local residents hide in a basement in Sudzha, Kursk region. (Source: Associated Press)Ukrainian officials and soldiers have said diverting Russian reserves from the main battlegrounds in eastern Ukraine is a minimum aim of the Kursk offensive, but Moscow has shown no signs of withdrawing significant numbers of troops from battles there or slowing their tempo.ADVERTISEMENTZelensky has said Ukraine will establish a command office in Sudzha to coordinate aid and military affairs. That suggests Ukraine may plan to remain in the Kursk region long-term â€“ or at least wants to signal to Moscow that it might.Ukraine's Western backers have remained largely silent about the surprise operation, though US President Joe Biden said that he's been kept abreast of developments.Sudzha, which had a population of just 5000 before the conflict began, holds some strategic importance. From the town, troops can access main roads to continue with their operation in Russia.Natural gas flowing from West Siberian gas fields to Central Europe via Ukraine passes through a metering station in the Sudzha district. However, Ukraine can also cut this gas flow from its own territory.In the Russian town, residents huddled in a school basement. As they wondered about their fate, Ukrainian forces pushed their advance in Kursk. Fighting continued south of Korenevo, a town similar in size to Sudzha that would be an important tactical gain.
summary:Ukrainian forces surged into Russia, capturing the town of Sudzha and causing chaos in their unexpected incursion. With scenes of destruction and artillery damage, the Ukrainian troops have energized their forces and thrown Russia off balance. The conflict's dynamics have shifted, with civilians evacuated and a strategic advantage for Ukraine, even as questions linger about the operation's goals and potential consequences. This bold move has global implications as both sides assess the situation in this tense standoff.

article:Terminally-ill Australians opting to end their lives using voluntary assisted dying still make up a small sliver of total deaths, yet growing demand has prompted calls to streamline the process and bolster the workforce. In a landmark Go Gentle Australia report into voluntary assisted dying — now legal in every jurisdiction except the Northern Territory — 2,460 people were found to have opted to end their lives with the service. In 2017, Victoria became the first state to legalise voluntary assisted dying, intended for those with a terminal illness suffering immense pain and wanting control over the circumstances of their death. Chief executive officer of the charity, Linda Swan said the evidence painted a "reassuring picture of systems fulfilling their aim" with health professionals providing "kind and meticulous" support. "None of the dire predictions from opponents have come to pass and systems are working safely and with great compassion," she said. The typical applicant was in their 70s with a terminal cancer diagnosis and were slightly more likely to be male, the report found. Applicants were usually well-educated, English speakers, and four in five were receiving palliative care. Applicants were three times more likely to die at home. While voluntary assisted dying only made up somewhere between 0.5 per cent and 1.6 per cent in total deaths, demand was growing and there were still a number of barriers to access. While a "person-directed" process, Swan said it was not clear if there was the right balance between safeguards and accessibility. "Gag clauses" in South Australia and Victoria, which prevent health professionals from raising the option with patients, meant many did not know about the option. "No other health care requires patients to know their treatment options before consulting a doctor," Swan said. More health professionals needed to be encouraged to complete the voluntary assisted dying training, with the report recommending they be fairly compensated. Seventeen health bodies, including the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia and the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, were calling for reform to the Commonwealth Criminal Code so people could use phone, email and telehealth as part of the process. Existing rules force applicants to attend all appointments in person, which is particularly burdensome for those living in regional or remote areas.
summary:A report from Go Gentle Australia reveals that voluntary assisted dying is becoming more popular among terminally-ill Australians, with growing demand for streamlined processes and more support. Since its legalization in most Australian jurisdictions, over 2,400 individuals have opted for this end-of-life option, which was first introduced in Victoria in 2017 for those facing terminal illnesses and seeking control over their death circumstances. The process has been described as safe and compassionate, with most applicants being educated, English-speaking individuals in their 70s dealing with terminal cancer. Despite its growing popularity, barriers to access, such as lack of awareness and restrictions on telehealth consultations, still persist. Calls for reforms, including better training for health professionals and more flexibility in appointment requirements, are being made to improve accessibility to this end-of-life choice.

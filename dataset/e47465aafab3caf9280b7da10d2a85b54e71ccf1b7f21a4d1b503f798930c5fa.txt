article:There has been a breakthrough in an intriguing case A Current Affair reported on last month. Sydney man Andre Azar said his trust was abused after his vehicle was allegedly stolen in an online car sale gone wrong. The Azars wanted a quick sale, so they listed it for $5000 to $6000 less than market value and were contacted within hours by prospective buyers. That night the prospective buyers, a young couple, were welcomed into the Azar family home, in Sydney\’s south west. They told Andre their names and they even showed him NSW Government issued photo IDs. What followed was a hard-luck story that resulted in a cheque deposited into Azar\’s account and his vehicle registered to another owner despite there being no paperwork. But A Current Affair was there when police came knocking.
summary:A recent development has unfolded in a fascinating case previously featured on A Current Affair. Sydney resident Andre Azar recounted feeling betrayed when his car seemingly disappeared after a questionable online sale. The Azars aimed for a swift transaction, offering their vehicle at a significant discount. Shortly after listing, a young couple expressed interest and swiftly visited their home in south-west Sydney. Despite presenting government IDs and a convincing story, the situation turned murky, with a check deposited in Azar's account and the car registered under a different name. Surprisingly, police intervened during the investigation.

article:Family of mum who died saving baby in Bondi attack speaksFamily handout A GoFundMe has been set up in Ashlee Good's name which has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for her surviving familyThe partner of a mother killed while saving her baby from a stabbing rampage in a busy Sydney shopping centre has spoken out for the first time, saying the day she died will "never make sense". Ashlee Good, 38, was among six people killed by Joel Cauchi at Westfield Bondi Junction on 13 April. Her daughter Harriet, who was nine months old at the time of the attack, was also injured. Australian authorities say the stabbing was "mental health" related, but they believe Cauchi targeted women. Thanking those who had sent donations, Good's partner Dan Flanagan said "the overwhelming support, kindness and generosity" his family had received has given them "strength".Mass killings are rare in Australia, and the attack - at one of the country's biggest and most popular shopping centres - stunned the world. Horrified witnesses have described how Good fled into a nearby store, desperately seeking help for her injured baby girl. In a post to a GoFundMe page, which raised almost A$850,000 (Â£439,000;$560,000), Mr Flanagan said the loss of his partner - an osteopath who friends described as "full of life and love" - was "unimaginable". "The day our family of three became a family of two will never make sense to me, but countless people... have shown me that while tragic things do unfortunately happen, there is more good in this world, than bad," he wrote. "Nothing will ever dull the pain of losing Ash, but reading your messages and seeing what an impact Ash has had on so many people has provided a lot of comfort."
summary:Ashlee Good, a hero who sacrificed her life to save her baby during a tragic attack in Sydney, has left behind a grieving family. Her partner, Dan Flanagan, expressed his gratitude for the outpouring of support they have received. Ashlee's bravery and the love she shared have touched many hearts, as evidenced by the overwhelming donations that have poured in to help her family. The senseless loss of Ashlee will never be understood, but the kindness of strangers has provided some solace to her loved ones during this unimaginably difficult time.

article:Two Australians are among five people to have miraculously walked away unharmed after their helicopter crashed into a village in Bali. Russell Harris embarked on the scenic flight with his Indonesian partner Keylla and his friend from Perth, Chris, about 2.30pm yesterday to celebrate his 46th birthday. About four minutes after the trio took off with two crew members from South Kuta, they noticed a kite in their path. With the kite string tangled around the main rotor, the helicopter lost control and quickly dropped about 40 metres down a cliff near Suluban Beach.  "Tree first, we hit them, I remember that, then we hit a cliff, flipped us upside down and came to a stop," Harris recalled. Miraculously, all five people on board survived, most with just minor injuries.

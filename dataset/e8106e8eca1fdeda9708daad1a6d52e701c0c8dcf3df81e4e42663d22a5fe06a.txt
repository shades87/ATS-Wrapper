article:There has been a breakthrough in an intriguing case A Current Affair reported on last month. Sydney man Andre Azar said his trust was abused after his vehicle was allegedly stolen in an online car sale gone wrong. The Azars wanted a quick sale, so they listed it for $5000 to $6000 less than market value and were contacted within hours by prospective buyers. That night the prospective buyers, a young couple, were welcomed into the Azar family home, in Sydney\’s south west. They told Andre their names and they even showed him NSW Government issued photo IDs. What followed was a hard-luck story that resulted in a cheque deposited into Azar\’s account and his vehicle registered to another owner despite there being no paperwork. But A Current Affair was there when police came knocking.
summary:In a recent update to a previous news story, a man named Andre Azar from Sydney had his trust violated in a car sale that went awry. The Azars opted for a quick sale, listing their car well below market value, attracting immediate interest from a young couple. The couple visited their home, shared their identities, and issued a cheque to Azar, leading to the car being registered to a different owner without official paperwork. The situation escalated when the police got involved, as reported by A Current Affair.

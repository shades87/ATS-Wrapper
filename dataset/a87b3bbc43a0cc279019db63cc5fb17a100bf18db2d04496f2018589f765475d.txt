It's really good preparation for next week."I think I'd rather play, and whether it's good or bad this week, to be on that momentum of competitively playing and I know I get a good three weeks off after the Open."After failing to record a top-10 finish in more than four months, Ko now has a little momentum on her side, finishing tied for eighth at the CPKC Women's Open in Canada last month, before her Paris triumph.
summary:Olympic and LPGA Hall of Famer, Lydia Ko, is performing well at the Scottish Open, just two shots off the lead after two rounds. Despite bad weather causing suspensions, Ko has shown her skill with four birdies in her second round. She nearly skipped the event after her emotional win last week, but decided it was valuable preparation for next week’s British Open at St Andrews. Ko's recent improvement after a string of no top-10 finishes is a positive sign as she aims for continued success.

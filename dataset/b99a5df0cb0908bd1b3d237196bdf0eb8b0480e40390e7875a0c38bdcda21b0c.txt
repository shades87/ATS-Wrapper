article:There has been a breakthrough in an intriguing case A Current Affair reported on last month. Sydney man Andre Azar said his trust was abused after his vehicle was allegedly stolen in an online car sale gone wrong. The Azars wanted a quick sale, so they listed it for $5000 to $6000 less than market value and were contacted within hours by prospective buyers. That night the prospective buyers, a young couple, were welcomed into the Azar family home, in Sydney\’s south west. They told Andre their names and they even showed him NSW Government issued photo IDs. What followed was a hard-luck story that resulted in a cheque deposited into Azar\’s account and his vehicle registered to another owner despite there being no paperwork. But A Current Affair was there when police came knocking.
summary:A recent development has emerged in a compelling case that was previously featured on A Current Affair. In this story, a Sydney man named Andre Azar found himself in a troubling situation when his car was allegedly stolen during an online sale. The Azars were eager for a quick transaction and listed the vehicle well below market value, leading to rapid interest from potential buyers. After inviting a young couple who claimed to be interested buyers into their home, a series of events unfolded that ended with the couple convincing Azar to accept a check and transferring the vehicle's registration without proper documentation. However, things took a turn when law enforcement intervened.

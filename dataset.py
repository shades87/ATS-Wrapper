    articleText = ['Bad actors seizing on Microsoft IT outage to scam public, Clare O’Neil warns Home affairs minister says small businesses should be cautious of emails from people posing as CrowdStrike or Microsoft Scammers are attempting to use the global CrowdStrike outage on Microsoft Windows systems to steal from small businesses by offering fake fixes, the Australian government has warned. The world has begun to recover from a global outage of Windows systems running the cybersecurity company Crowdstrike’s software, after the company issued a faulty update. But bad actors have seized upon the crisis to attempt to scam the public, the home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, said on Saturday. “What we are seeing some reporting of is attempts to conduct phishing through the incident that just occurred,” she said. She said small businesses in particular were receiving emails from people pretending to be CrowdStrike or Microsoft and seeking bank details to access a reboot to fix the error. “I ask Australians to be really cautious over the next few days about attempts to use this for scamming or phishing,” she said. “If you see an email, if you see a text message that looks a little bit funny, that indicates something about CrowdStrike or IT outages, just stop. Don’t put any details.” She said if people receive calls along those lines they should hang up, and if people do hand over their banking information then to contact their bank immediately to report it. “This is a moment where we can help our fellow Australian citizens. If someone has tried to scam you, they are trying to scam others,” she said. “You can help protect your fellow citizens by jumping online, going to the Scamwatch website and just report back what’s happened so we can make sure that the government can continue to alert people as we move forward.” The Australian Cyber Security Centre warned on Saturday that a number of malicious websites and “unofficial code” were being released, claiming to help businesses recover from the outage. The centre said it “strongly encourages all consumers to source their technical information and updates from official CrowdStrike sources only”. CrowdStrike’s own threat intelligence reported that malicious activity includes phishing emails posing as CrowdStrike support or independent researchers selling scripts to automate recovery from the issue. The organisation identified more than 30 domains that had been used in the scams so far. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission deputy chair, Catriona Lowe, warned the public not to download unsolicited software and to be wary of any unsolicited calls or emails. Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters “Criminals look to take advantage of incidents like this CrowdStrike outage, creating a sense of urgency that you need to do what they say to protect your computer and your financial information,” Lowe said. “Anyone can be scammed, so it is important to be wary of any unsolicited contact that purports to provide assistance in the aftermath of a major event like this.” O’Neil said the Australian economy was in a recovery phase after Friday’s outage, but there would still be teething problems for some businesses in bringing their services back online.',
                   'The Wallabies survived a scare to keep their unbeaten run under Joe Schmidt alive with a hard-earned 40-29 victory over Georgia in Sydney. The 12th-ranked Georgians threatened to spring a surprise after closing to within two points of the hosts early in the second half before the Wallabies kicked away late at Allianz Stadium on Saturday. Schmidt made 10 changes to the side that beat Wales 36-28 last Saturday in Melbourne and some seized the opportunity, while others didn’t. New flyhalf Ben Donaldson didn’t look the answer to Australia’s playmaking dilemma, his kicking and decision-making too often poor. The Wallabies had the tireless back row of Fraser McReight, Rob Valetini and Harry Wilson largely to thank for helping secure three straight wins for the national side for the first time since 2021 when under Dave Rennie. Lock Nick Frost and first-time starting prop Isaac Kailea were also strong but the first-half dismissal of winger Filipo Daugunu for a dangerous tackle made life difficult for the home side. Daugunu’s initial yellow card for kneeing Georgian winger Demur Tapladze in the head while airborne and trying to charge down a kick was elevated to a red at half-time. The disruption didn’t help Schmidt’s new-look outfit as they struggled to put the spirited eastern Europeans away. Still, the Wallabies looked to have the game wrapped up with a 26-10 lead into the break. After falling behind to a second-minute penalty goal to impressive Georgia five-eighth Luka Matkava, the Wallabies crossed for three tries in 15 minutes through centre Hunter Paisami, Valetini and Kailea. Then the hosts lost their way. Ill-discipline and Daugunu’s departure invited the eastern Europeans back into the contest as Georgia reduced the deficit to 19-10 with a 33rd-minute converted try to lock Micheil Babunashvili. Only a driving maul try to man of the match McReight on the stroke of half-time gave the Wallabies some breathing space. And it didn’t last long as Georgia closed to within two points of Australia with two scintillating tries early in the second half through fullback Davit Niniashvili and lightning winger Akaki Tabutsadze. For all their pluck and resilience, the tide turned back in the Wallabies’ favour after Georgia themselves were reduced to 14 men with the sin-binning of Niniashvili for a deliberate knock down as Australia pounded their line. A McReight break and 40-metre burst set up Valetini’s second try and there was no coming back from The Lelos. McReight completed his own try double to restore Australia’s 16-point advantage before Tabutsadze crossed for a consolation second five-pointer late on. Schmidt, conceding pre-match it was difficult to strike a balance between building depth and winning, will take the victory. But after Eddie Jones’ side downed Georgia by 20 points during last year’s ill-fated World Cup campaign, the new coach will also recognise the Wallabies need to improve markedly for their Rugby Championship opener against the top-ranked Springboks in Brisbane on 10 August.',
                   'You’ve likely heard of Project 2025. It’s a set of conservative policy recommendations written by a right-wing policy group for the next U.S. Republican President. Democrats have attacked Trump’s ties to the plan as some advisers from his first term have been involved. However, Trump has publicly distanced himself from it. Here’s what you need to know. Project 2025 is organised by a right-wing policy group, The Heritage Foundation. It’s helped shape the policies of Republican Presidents since Ronald Reagan won in 1981. They claim two-thirds of its recommendations have been implemented. The Heritage Foundation says Project 2025 will undo “the damage the Left has wrought” through immigration, abortion, defence, tax, and education policies. It has four main pillars: a policy agenda, a personnel database, a “Presidential Administration Academy”, and a 180-Day Playbook. 1. The Policy Agenda is the 900-page document that contains a series of policy proposals to “rescue [the U.S.] from the grip of the radical left” and to dismantle the “woke left”. On immigration, the group wants to dismantle the current Department of Homeland Security and reorganise most national security agencies to strengthen the country’s border policing operation. It wants to increase funding for a wall on the U.S-Mexico border, saying the border should be “sealed.” On healthcare, Project 2025 says it prioritises “protecting life, conscience, and bodily integrity.” It wants to see the abortion pill mifepristone pulled from the market and greater restrictions imposed. It states: “Abortion and euthanasia are not health care.” On climate change, the group says while it supports “creating a better environmental tomorrow”, the Government needs to “stop the war on oil and natural gas.” It wants to slash funding for renewable energy completely. 2. The Personnel Database registry allows supporters of the movement to build professional profiles to create a streamlined hiring process. 3. A “Presidential Administration Academy” would provide future political employees with the education and skillset to advance the movement once in the White House. 4. The 180-Day Playbook details a concrete plan for Trump’s first six months and proposes instructions for federal agencies on their first course of action, if he wins. Trump claims he “knows nothing” about Project 2025, and has called some of the policies “absolutely ridiculous and abysmal”. However, many of his closest policy advisers are involved. Russell T. Vought, Trump’s former Director of the Office of Management and Budget, authored one of the plan’s chapters. Stephen Miller, a former Trump adviser who’s expected to return to the White House if Trump wins, has been associated with a legal team on Project 2025’s advisory board. Although Trump has set his own agenda clear in a 16-page document on his website, critics have spotted similarities between Project 2025 and his policies. For example, one of Trump’s immigration policies is to “seal the border and stop the migrant invasion”. Trump says he also “proudly stands for families and life.” He is against “late-term abortion”, but says he endorses birth control and IVF. Trump wants the U.S. to be “the Number One Producer” of oil and natural gas. Democratic President Joe Biden continues to accuse Trump of having deep ties with Project 2025, saying it’s “run and paid for by Trump people”. At a campaign rally in Michigan over the weekend, Biden warned American voters that Project 2025 is the “biggest attack on our system of government and our personal freedom that has ever been proposed in the history of this country.”',
                   'At least 19 people have died during student-led protests in Bangladesh. Anti-government rallies have caused chaos in parts of the country’s capital Dhaka, as students call for a jobs quota system to be scrapped. Under the system, more than 30% of public service jobs in Bangladesh are reserved for families of veterans who served in the country’s war of independence. Protesters, who have been gathering at university campuses, have called the quotas “discriminatory”. In 1971, East and West Pakistan fought in a war that ended with the creation of an independent Bangladesh. Shortly after independence, then-leader Sheikh Mujibur Rehman introduced a quota system for public service jobs — around one in three roles were reserved for soldiers who served in the Bangladesh independence war, and their relatives. The quota system was in place until 2018, when similar protests led to its suspension. The country’s High Court reinstated it last month. This month, tens of thousands of students have led protests calling for an end to the public service quota. Protesters are calling for the system to be overhauled, so staff are appointed to public service roles based on merit, not heritage. Student-led blockades and protests have spread across several cities in Bangladesh, including Chattogram and Rangpur. Demonstrators have blocked roads in the capital, Dhaka, prompting an escalation of violence and clashes with security officials. Riot police have been deployed to shut down protests. Footage shows police using tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds. Internet and mobile services have been cut off in some parts of the country. Clashes between police and students killed at least 19 people. Some media reports estimate the death toll is higher. Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina has condemned the violence. In a televised address, she announced there would be a “judicial investigation” into the protest and incidents of violence. She also said the country’s top court, the Supreme Court, is weighing up the future of the quota system and is expected to hand down a decision next month. United Nations Human Rights chief, Volker Türk, has urged Bangladesh officials to engage with protesters. “Freedom of expression & peaceful assembly are fundamental human rights,” he posted on X. The U.S. Embassy in Dhaka has temporarily closed to the public due to security concerns. Australia has updated its travel advice to “exercise a high degree of caution” for Bangladesh, citing widespread unrest.',
                   'Inside a vault of this data centre is what looks like a hotel for computers. It\'s noisy and hot. Each of these blinking server racks belongs to a business or an organisation. They house their critical infrastructure and data here because it\'s highly secure – with layers of security including ID checks and fingerprints just to get in. "Whether that\'s networking or just general computer infrastructure," David Dzienciol, chief customer and commercial officer of NEXTDC, told The Business inside a data hall. "We run 14 data centres across the country, servicing customers from the largest multinationals, through to Australia\'s largest companies all the way through to small business. "We rely on technology for everything, whether it\'s our health care, banking services or government services. "There\'s no industry that isn\'t reliant on data today." Australia is one of the top five data centre hubs in the world. There are 214 data centres spread across the country, according to the Australian Information Industry Association. With the explosion of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, the industry is expected to grow exponentially. "We believe that we are at the beginning of a massive shift with AI," Mr Dzienciol said. "We truly believe that we\'re at the beginning of a change in accelerated computing that could see demand skyrocket over the next decade." Data centres are already big power users in Australia. They need significant amounts of electricity to run high-intensity computing and cooling systems. Just one large data centre can consume the same amount of energy required to power 50,000 homes. Morgan Stanley estimates that data centres are currently using 5 per cent (1,050 MW) of the electricity on Australia\'s power grid and that is expected to grow to 8 per cent (2,500 MW) by 2030. Some estimates even suggest they could require up to 15 per cent of the power on the grid by then. As the nation races to electrify, with households dumping gas appliances and more people driving electric vehicles, the grid is already under pressure from rising demand. The Australian Energy Market Operator\'s latest Integrated Systems Plan anticipates overall electricity consumption from the grid to nearly double by 2050. The director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, Bruce Mountain, said Australia was not well placed to cope with that increasing demand. "We are now hitting the difficult stages of the energy transition," Professor Mountain told The Business. "We\'ve got wind and sun and land, but we don\'t have other clean energy, biomass or decent amounts of hydro or nuclear. "And that\'s a disadvantage that we face that other countries don\'t face." Professor Mountain thinks although the data centre sector is a vital service to Australia\'s economy, the boom will make the energy transition more challenging. "They make the transition challenge harder, because not just that you need to replace coal-fired generation, you need to build new capacity to meet rising demand," he said. "It\'s not yet an insurmountable problem, but if the demand continues to escalate at the rate it has, based on the recent developments, I think it is an issue." The director of the Energy Program at Grattan Institute, Tony Wood, agreed that the sector presents a unique challenge to the grid. "That means putting pressure on our electricity grid. It means even putting pressure on our greenhouse gas emissions," he said. "If you add a lot more demand, and you don\'t add more supply, then prices go up. "I think governments can get on top of this, but now is the time to be doing it.  Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the first auction of the Capacity Investment Scheme, which will support 6GW of new power, has received more than 40GW of project registrations, showing there is a strong pipeline of renewables ready to go. Energy retailer and generator Origin supplies power to about a third of all data centres in Australia. The man in charge of these accounts said the company was looking at a range of options to meet their needs. "Typically, we will look at solutions like distributed generation, so wind or solar at site, storage solutions and backup generation, and using energy from the grid as well," James Magill, head of Origin Zero, told The Business. "Our customers, with their forecasts, would vary somewhat, but typically, those growth forecasts could be between about 10 and 30 per cent per year." Mr Magill said to meet those energy demands, companies could be strategic about where they build data centres.',
                   'After eight years of financial heartbreak and court battles, the liquidator of Clive Palmer\'s former Queensland Nickel refinery says it has paid the company\'s creditors in full.  The Yabulu Nickel Refinery, owned by Queensland Nickel Industries, was the Townsville region\'s largest private employer when it collapsed in 2016, owing hundreds of millions of dollars. More than 700 workers lost their jobs. Liquidator FTI announced yesterday that outstanding creditors had been paid $300 million — a full settlement of claims, it said. FTI senior managing director Kelly Trenfield said when FTI was first appointed, it estimated QNI owed about $800 million. Many of those claims had been settled, removed or reduced over the past eight years. She said recovering the final $300 million owed to creditors had been a long process. "The thing that really got us was the number of people who were directly impacted, whether they were employees or direct suppliers," she said. "We were made very keenly aware of people\'s emotional involvement, there were employees who had worked there for decades." FTI said it had distributed federal government payments of $70 million to nearly all 787 former QNI employees. There were about 1,500 creditors in total, including local infrastructure suppliers including rail, power and ports, according to Ms Trenfield. In 2019, the Townsville City Council launched legal action to recover $2.5 million from QNI Metals Propriety Limited and QNI Resources, claiming the companies had not paid their rates or charges at the Yabalu refinery or a property since 2016. A spokesperson for the council confirmed yesterday that payment for outstanding rates and charges was received in August 2020. Queensland Nickel\'s liquidators had pursued Mr Palmer\'s companies since the QNI collapse, prompting lengthy court battles with the billionaire. Ms Trenfield said the largest amount of money recovered was $102 million, from Mr Palmer\'s company Mineralogy. She said there were court proceedings to be finalised before the liquidation could conclude, but indicated the end was in sight. "It\'s so nice to see a complete payment back to creditors even if it has taken eight years," she said. In 2022, Mr Palmer sold the Yabulu refinery to Swiss buyers, sparking hope the refinery would be fired back up within 18 months.  But the future of the operation remains unclear. Monash University critical minerals researcher Professor David Whittle said any company looking to revive the operation faced an uphill battle. Earlier this month, mining giant BHP announced it was putting its WA nickel mines on ice for at least three years, blaming an "oversupply in the global nickel market. Professor Whittle said Australian nickel producers faced increasing competition from low-cost producers in Russia and Indonesia. "It\'s very challenging, nickel prices are famously volatile," he said. "Back in 2007 it got up to $50,000 per tonne. It\'s around $16,000 a tonne now. It\'s been as low as $5,000 a tonne.',
                   'Australia\’s first alleged Christian terrorists forged their fateful bond decades ago when they jointly accused two of their parents of child sexual abuse and cut all family ties. Nathaniel, Gareth and Stacey Train died in a shootout with Queensland police after killing three people, including two officers, on a remote property at Wieambilla on the Darling Downs in December 2022. Police have concluded the trio "executed a religiously motivated terrorist attack", believing the world was ending and police were "monsters and demons". How the trio reached this point will be examined in an upcoming coronial inquest into the shooting. A clue has been offered by Nathaniel and Gareth\’s father in an interview with ABC\’s Background Briefing. Ron Train has revealed for the first time to Background Briefing that his sons cut contact in 1999 after alleging they were abused as children. Estranged from the family, the trio then moved around regional Australia, frequently sharing a home. In the last year of their lives, they were isolated and paranoid, culminating in the police shooting. Ron Train said he and his late wife, Gwen, were horrified by the allegations against them. "That was the devastating thing to me, to think these boys who I had raised and loved … made certain allegations which were totally false and unproven," he said. Ron and Gwen\’s other children stuck by their parents following the estrangement. The Train brothers met Stacey Christoffel as teenagers through a Baptist church in Toowoomba, where their father, Ron, was a minister. Ron Train said Stacey took the lead in ventilating the abuse claims during a family wedding in Coffs Harbour in 1999. In the first of this two-part investigation into Australia\’s first Christian terrorists, reporter Josh Robertson examines how a trio from Queensland forged a bond that would turn deadly. She and Nathaniel, who were then married with two young children, turned up unexpectedly with Nathaniel\’s brother, Gareth, after avoiding the family for months. "Stacey blew her top and made certain accusations against Gwen, which bewildered Gwen," Ron Train said. "She flew off the handle. She was very aggressive. "I heard all the commotion, and my brother got up and went out to find out what it was. And he asked Stacey to leave the house because of her behaviour." Nathaniel and Gareth told Ron\’s brother they\’d been "sexually abused" at home in Richmond, north-west of Sydney, where the family lived until the boys were aged six and seven respectively. "My brother said to them, \’Don\’t be ridiculous. You know your mother and father loved you very much … and wouldn\’t even contemplate such things,\’" Ron recalls. Ron said Nathaniel tried to begin a "rational discussion" with him but "Stacey flew in and … pulled him away". He said he later wrote to his sons, challenging their claims and suggesting they be put to the family doctor, but the brothers never responded. Ron said he asked about the abuse allegations when meeting a Queensland Police detective investigating the 2022 shootings. "[The detective] said: \’We\’ve investigated all that stuff. There\’s nothing in that at all.\’" Queensland Police told Background Briefing it was not appropriate to comment on matters relevant to a coronial inquest, with hearings beginning July 29. A relative told Background Briefing the broader family did not consider the abuse allegations credible. This relative said Nathaniel accused his mother of harming her children by walking around the house in her underwear. Ron Train said he believed Stacey had a "major influence" on the Train family upheaval. She had been "deeply troubled" by her own family\’s handling of a suspected sexual predator within its ranks, he said. She was distressed to learn her parents had invited a relative accused of sexual abuse to her 1995 wedding without informing her of the allegations. Ron says Stacey wanted her parents to be publicly castigated in the Church where he was a minister. "And I said, \’No, I\’m not going to put your parents in an embarrassing situation\’. "Well, that didn\’t go down well with Nathaniel and Stacey." He said the couple also pressured him to reveal what he had known about the alleged abuse. "I knew some of the circumstances, but because it had been shared to me in confidence as a pastor, I couldn\’t share any information, and that disturbed [Stacey and Nathaniel]," he said. Stacey\’s father, Philip Christoffel, declined to comment. Mr Train said the trio\’s decision to "sever ties with both our family and Stacey\’s family was devastating". "I thought, that\’s a big thing to do, to walk away from two families and try to develop themselves, the three of them — Stacey, Gareth, Nathaniel." Ron would not see his two grandchildren again for decades. Following the estrangement, Nathaniel left his job at a high school with an elite sports program near the Gold Coast, and moved with Stacey and Gareth to north Queensland. Nathaniel and Stacey began carving out careers as teachers in Indigenous education. It eventually filtered back to the families that Stacey had left Nathaniel for Gareth. This was deeply at odds with their conservative Christian upbringing. Stacey and Gareth then primarily raised Nathaniel\’s children, who later went to boarding school. "[Gareth] wanted to be head of his own family. That was his dream," Ron said. "He achieved it, but at the expense of Nathaniel and Stacey\’s marriage, in my view. "I see it as an absolute betrayal." Despite Gareth replacing Nathaniel as Stacey\’s husband, the trio lived together on and off and bought a house on the Atherton Tablelands in 2004. Ron said when Stacey\’s parents tried to reconcile with her that year: "Gareth came to the door with a baseball bat and said, \’Get out of here.\’" Ron said he took his own shot at reconciliation the following year, with his wife, Gwen. "Gareth and Stacy were inside somewhere," he recalls. "Nathaniel answered the door. I said, \’Can you speak to Mum and I, mate,\’ and he said, \’No, Dad. Off the property, please.\’" Ron said that even before the estrangement, Nathaniel and Gareth were the closest of his four children despite their starkly different personalities. Nathaniel, a junior tennis champion who achieved at school, was a "calming influence" and "on track to help people". Gareth was "more aggressive, controlling" and had learning difficulties. He was expelled from an agricultural college in Dalby after throwing another student through a pane of glass. Nathaniel and Gareth applied to join the Australian Defence Force, but abandoned the plan when Gareth "failed the psych test", according to Ron. The estrangement brought the brothers even closer, forging a bond that survived Gareth taking Nathaniel\’s wife. Stacey and Gareth Train in a video posted to YouTube on the night of the police shooting at Wieambilla, in rural Queensland. Ron believes Nathaniel initially stayed close to his brother and ex-wife "to have contact with his children". But he suspects the connection ran deeper than that. He could not picture Nathaniel buying into unhinged conspiracy theories like Gareth and Stacey, who were "two people extreme in their ideas". But ultimately, Nathaniel was "certainly under the influence of Gareth and Stacey to support them through whatever reckoning was going to take place". "There was certainly a loyalty bond between Gareth and Nathaniel, which is — I don\’t know whether it\’s [implicitly] disturbing, but in the end, it worked out that way," Ron said.',
                   'Nursing a wonky knee and needing two cortisone injections for her neck, Melissa Wu went further north in her body to make Australian diving history. The 32-year-old focused heavily on her mind and it has paid off, with Wu about to be the first Australian to dive at five Olympics. Last month, Wu secured Olympic selection by winning the 10m platform at the national championships. Just four weeks out from the nationals, Wu\’s injuries meant the two-time Olympic medallist had been unable to practise her competition dives. "As time goes on, it gets harder and harder — not just because I\’ve had a lot of injuries, but it\’s putting your body through a gruelling sport like diving," she said. "The older I get, the more I appreciate it, definitely. This has been a lot harder, this prep … not just physically, but having that trust in myself. "I had to work very hard in my mindset. I started doing visualisation, something I\’d always struggled to do. "I knew I was going to have to dig deep and find something, do something different to make this team." Given Wu\’s injury problems, some aspects of her training program have been reduced heavily and others, such as nutrition and psychology, have received a much sharper focus. "I knew to get through the trials, I was going to have to rely on a lot of the mindset work I was doing, trying to focus on doing as much of that as I could," she said. "I had to make a really strict plan as to how I was going to get there, when I was going to take up which dives. "I was nervous, but I knew that I really wanted to be on this team — it means a lot to me." Wu looks wistfully at what younger divers are doing in their training, but also knows what works now for her. After repeatedly hitting the water at 60km/h from 10m up, her body needs a different preparation. "I can\’t train like the young guns any more. Now it\’s about being smart … making sure that everything I\’m doing in training is in preparation to be on that 10m platform in Paris," she said. "I\’ve had to learn that more is not always more and the way we\’ve always done things is not necessarily the right way for me, right now. "I see the younger athletes training and I want to do exactly what they\’re doing, and do it better. "But now it\’s knowing I need to trust myself, trust that what I\’m doing is enough." The women\’s 10m platform starts on Tuesday, August 6, at 11pm (AEST). ABC Sport will be live blogging all the action overnight through the Paris Olympics.',

Geoff Meyer, Managing Director of Oceania for The IRONMAN Group, said IRONMAN 70.3 WA continued to be popular with athletes from all over the world. "We\’re thrilled with the response from athletes... which means we have put up the sold-out sign for this year\’s event, with the only way that athletes can now be involved being through the IRONMAN race," he said. "Athletes from across Australia and around the world are set to make their way to Busselton for this event that is on the bucket list of so many triathletes. "It\’s easy to see why this event is popular, from the incredible swim that goes alongside and under the historic Jetty, to the flat and fast bike course and the run that is lined with cheering spectators." Busselton Mayor Phill Cronin said the sellout was a salute to organisers and the region. "Don\’t despair if you missed out, there\’s still opportunity for triathletes to participate in Busselton for 2024 by signing up for the IRONMAN race, this year celebrating its 20th anniversary in beautiful Busselton," he said.',
                   'The Geographe Community Landcare Nursery (GCLN) is celebrating a much-needed boost in funding thanks to a 2024 NAB Foundation Community Grant. The $10,496.00 grant will be used to purchase 12 workbenches and two trollies, as part of the Nursery\’s Drought Recovery Initiative. But there\’s more to be done to help the group achieve its goal of increasing production of local native plants. "Our region has just experienced the hottest and driest Summer and Autumn on record, and we are anticipating a higher demand for drought tolerant species to replace some of the plants lost in the drought," GCLN\’s Anne Grove explained. She said the South West was showing severe signs of heat, and drought stress, and all evidence pointed to an increased frequency and severity of long, dry periods. "When the dry effects the flora, it has a roll-on effect on our native wildlife, restricting or decimating both habitat and food sources. Volunteers at the Geographe Community Landcare Nursery were presented with a cheque for more than $10,000 thanks to the NAB Foundation Community Grant program. Picture supplied. "With this in mind, the purpose of our organisation is heightened and the production of native species with local provenance has never been more important. "Based on the evidence, we anticipate the demand for our native plants will increase substantially over the next 3 years and continue to grow exponentially thereon." The Nursery was one of 25 organisations across Australia to share in $600,000 from the latest round of the NAB Foundation program. Anne said the generous grant would help the Nursery purchase benches to increase production, but it was in desperate need of additional hands on deck. "The Nursery\’s ability to meet this increasing demand in the short term is currently restricted by a shortage of volunteers to help us propagate more plants and this is now becoming quite urgent," she said. "Having sufficient volunteers to undertake this propagation task is a key component of our success." If you would like to help with growing plants for revegetation of bushland, farming areas, home gardens and public parks, please contact Anne admin@gcln.org.au or 0438 930 898.',
                   'This popular Japanese item is popping up in more 7-Eleven stores than ever before — and Aussies are hoping it\’s a sign of more things to come. A social media user took to Reddit to express their excitement at finding teriyaki chicken onigiri at a 7-Eleven store. “Japanese food starting to pop up at 7/11 since the Japanese 7/11 buyout,” they captioned the image. Others were over the moon at the discovery. “This is the best news I\’ve heard in a while. Japanese 7/11 is incredible,” one commented. Onigiri is now available in more 7-Eleven stores. Another said, “These are delicious.” However, it turns out it has nothing to do with new 7-Eleven Australia being purchased by 7-Eleven International. Onigiri has been a staple of 7-Eleven stores in Victoria for years, and the popular item has now made its way up the east coast. “Our 7-Eleven Onigiri, like our other sushi, is delivered fresh daily,” a 7-Eleven spokesperson told news.com.au. “The onigiri are $3.70 and are available in three flavours Cooked Spicy Tuna, Chicken Teriyaki or Sweet Chilli Salmon. They have been available in Victoria for quite a few years, and launched in New South Wales and Queensland (other than Cairns and Townsville) over the last few months.” 7-Eleven International LLC announced in April that it had successfully acquired 7-Eleven Australia, adding 750 stores to its network. Aussies are hoping it means more Japanese products. Many speculated the takeover would transform the convenience store\’s food offerings, with social media users hoping it would take notes from the Japanese version of the chain. “Bring on the little pancakes in a packet,” one social media user pleaded. Another added, “I\’m so happy, I hope Japan purges the Australian market of bland food.” The 7-Eleven spokesperson said the Australian chain had a “long-term focus on our food offerings”. “Now as part of the 7-Eleven International network we are looking forward to working more closely with our international counterparts to grow our food offer,” they said. “Without question, 7-Eleven Japan has one of the best food offers in convenience in the world, so their expertise is going to be invaluable in helping to set a new benchmark for food here in Australia.”',
                   'A travel influencer has ripped a world-renowned restaurant for serving her “the worst meal” of her life — after dropping nearly $1,000 (AUD $1500) on a repast said to be so revolting, a neighbouring diner refused to pay. Chloe Jade Meltzer dropped the zero-star review in a series of videos for the restaurant in Spain\’s Basque Country — snagging eight million views on TikTok. “I truly cannot believe how bad this restaurant was,” Meltzer moaned in one of the posts, the New York Post reported. The object of the globetrotter\’s ire was Mugaritz, a two Michelin-starred establishment in San Sebastian, Spain, that regularly appears on lists of the world\’s best eateries. Andoni Luis Aduriz, the chef at Mugaritz, is renowned for his culinary creativity — which seems to have been altogether unappreciated by at least one table during the recent visit. “For approximately three hours, and through about 23-25 creations, together we will try to weave a tale of stories, gestures and emotions,” the restaurant\’s website promises potential diners. Chloe Jade Meltzner is a travel influencer. Picture: chloejadetravels/TikTok “Flavours, textures and aromas that you can enjoy and feel using your hands to stimulate all the senses and to evoke our more primal customs,” the pitch goes on. Meltzer said she was initially intrigued by the “inventive” setup, recalling how she selected her wine by picking a photo and telling the servers “three things about yourself” — like cabernet Charades. Unfortunately, the meal appeared to go downhill almost immediately with the arrival of the first dish, a vaseline-evoking blob of fish goop that patrons were required to eat with their hands. “I was essentially eating lip gloss,” lamented Meltzer, while licking the viscous gloop from her fingers like an aardvark. Other lowlights included a “sea rash” that the well-travelled eater compared to a “soggy cigar,” and a “belly button”-shaped Mold comprised of kefir and olive oil that diners are “supposed to suck weird juice out of” — like an interactive movie prosthetic.  Other alleged indignities inflicted included “charred spinach with BBQ sauce,” a fermented potato skin with more “disgusting BBQ sauce” — a combo that the influencer analogised to a “makeup wipe” — as well as some “old bucatini” and a “churro” that was actually uncooked plantain, clearly the culinary equivalent of catfishing. The total price tag for this malevolent-seeming meal? 897 Euros (AU $1496) for Meltzer\’s party. “I truly don\’t understand how this restaurant is in business,” fumed the content creator. “It is the worst restaurant I\’ve ever been to in my life.” And while Meltzer, an apparent pescetarian who admits to avoiding at least one meat dish during her measured take-down, observed that Mugaritz gives diners a disclaimer at the start warning them that they won\’t “like all of the dishes.” However, she said, it didn\’t make any sense for everything to be “utterly disgusting.” The TikTokker wasn\’t the only reviewer who felt that the restaurant was the emperor\’s new clothes. She claimed that one patron was “so tired of the BS” that he refused to pay the bill until the police were called, as seen in her second video. The TikTok commentariat was bemused by Meltzer\’s skewering with one writing “I am so obsessed with bad Michelin star restaurant reviews.” Another wrote, “This is why I don\’t go to Michelin star restaurants without extensive research and review. I don\’t mind paying the price but not for pretentious garbage.” Many compared the experience to the 2022 foodie thriller The Menu, in which unsuspecting patrons are invited to a sadistic social experiment under the guise of an avant-garde tasting menu. Mugaritz currently holds an average rating of 3.5 stars out of 5 on TripAdvisor, however the reviews from the past few months are overwhelmingly negative. One rater dubbed the experience “awful from start to finish”. “At the end of the day however clever you think you are as a chef — the food has to taste good and in reality the food is a disaster,” Meltzer declared. “From the 22 courses served there was not a single dish that I would ever want to eat again.” “Yes experiment, yes support local produce, yes be seasonal, yes, challenge the guests to a new experience — but somewhere along that journey it has to taste good,” she said.',
                   'President Joe Biden\’s top campaign staffer insists that he will stay in the race, even as calls grow among his fellow Democrats in Congress for him to end his floundering re-election bid and make way for a new candidate. More than one in eight congressional Democrats have now publicly called on the 81-year-old incumbent - who is isolating at his Delaware home with a case of COVID - to drop out following a disastrous June debate against Republican Donald Trump that raised questions about Biden\’s ability to win or to carry out his duties for another four years. The divide among Democrats stood in sharp contrast to the scenes that played out his week at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where former party rivals united around Trump, who accepted the Republican nomination in a rambling speech that featured his familiar mix of grievance and bombast. So far, 34 of the 264 congressional Democrats have publicly called for Biden to end his campaign, while other senior Democratic leaders have pushed him behind the scenes to do so, according to sources and media reports. They represent more than one in eight Democrats in Congress, where Biden\’s party controls 213 seats in the House of Representatives and 51 in the Senate. “We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardising what should be a winning campaign,” Representatives Jared Huffman, Marc Veasey, Chuy Garcia and Marc Pocan wrote in a letter on Friday. Democratic US Senator Martin Heinrich said on social media: “While the decision to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden\’s alone, I believe it is in the best interests of our country for him to step aside.” Democrats are increasingly worried about a Republican sweep in the November 5 election that could leave Trump and his allies not only in charge of the White House but also with majorities in both chambers of Congress.Pass the Torch, a group that wants Biden to step down, has launched a TV ad to air in Washington and Delaware. Biden had no public events scheduled for Friday, but a top adviser said he would return to the campaign trail next week. “He is absolutely in it,” Biden campaign chairwoman Jen O\’Malley Dillon told MSNBC in an interview. Former House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi is among those who have told Biden he cannot win in November, according to a White House source familiar with the matter. After weeks of insisting he will remain in the race, Biden is now taking calls to step aside seriously, and multiple Democratic officials think an exit is a matter of time, sources said. Though a Reuters/Ipsos poll earlier this week found Biden and Trump effectively tied, strategists from both parties say Biden\’s path to victory is narrowing as he trails in most of the battleground states that will decide the election. Were Biden to step aside as a candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, 59, could fill the role. Reuters/Ipsos polling shows her as performing marginally better against Trump in a theoretical head-to-head matchup. With his grip on the Republican Party never tighter, Trump is in a much stronger position than in his 2017-2021 term to follow through on his agenda if he wins the election. At the convention in Milwaukee, Trump delivered a dramatic account of the attempt on his life by a gunman at a Pennsylvania rally last Saturday and sought to appeal to undecided voters with a promise to be a president for “all of America, not half of America.” “In an age when our politics too often divide us, now is the time to remember that we are all fellow citizens,” Trump said. But he quickly abandoned the message of unity he had promised in the wake of the shooting, pivoting to well-worn attacks on the Biden administration. He claimed without evidence that his criminal indictments were part of a Democratic conspiracy, predicted Biden would usher in “World War III” and described what he called an “invasion” of migrants over the southern border. Trump devoted much of his 92-minute speech to attacking migrants, a theme that has always animated his campaigns.',
                   'At just 19 years old, Noah* had already lived a “tough life”. That was the assessment of NAB Bank customer advisor Rae Mulgrew, who was in the Colac branch, 150km southwest of Melbourne, when Noah walked in looking to buy a home. He hadn\’t had a place to call his own for years, but had diligently saved up thousands of dollars as he slept on couches. It was a sum of money he soon discovered still wasn\’t enough for a house deposit. That was before he was accepted into a government-run home buying scheme, under which another 35,000 places have opened up from July 1. A further 10,000 have been reserved for regional Australians like Noah, and another 5000 places reserved for single parents. Noah had $20,000 to his name when Mulgrew met him. “(But) even after saving every cent he made, he was still short of the 20 per cent deposit he thought he needed to secure a home loan,” she said. His journey towards homeownership wasn\’t thwarted so easily. Mulgrew and the manager of the Colac branch, Louise Morrissy, worked for months to help Noah secure a spot in the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee scheme. And the regional banking staff would later go beyond their professional responsibility to care for the young homebuyer — with a heartwarming gesture of support. “We have a strong connection to our community, and we really care for all the customers that walk through our door in Colac,” Morrisy said. The Home Guarantee Scheme is a government initiative that helps first home buyers, or buyers who have not owned a property over the past 10 years, to buy a home. It allows them to enter the market with a deposit of as little as 5 per cent, and without lenders mortgage insurance. Noah would become one of 1,600 regional, first-home buyers who NAB helped under the scheme last financial year. “Noah was determined to reach his goal of having his own place,” Mulgrew said. “He had no idea about the scheme when he first walked in. “Without it, he wouldn\’t have been able to get his foot on the property ladder.” Morrissy added: “We were by Noah\’s side every step of the way, walking him through the services he needed to engage in buying the property.” In true regional community-style, the Colac NAB team collected a care package full of items to congratulate Noah when he eventually received the keys to his first home. “We made up a little hamper of cups, saucers, sheets, you name it, just to get him started,” Morrissy said. “He kept telling me he couldn\’t give me anything in return, but I didn\’t want anything. “I just wanted to know he was settled and safe in his new home.” Mulgrew said: “The team in the branch felt we had to do something to make sure his house felt like a home.” For young, regional-based Australians looking for safe and secure housing, she said the scheme was empowering. “It makes the Australian dream achievable,” she said.

                   'Two Australians are among five people to have miraculously walked away unharmed after their helicopter crashed into a village in Bali. Russell Harris embarked on the scenic flight with his Indonesian partner Keylla and his friend from Perth, Chris, about 2.30pm yesterday to celebrate his 46th birthday. About four minutes after the trio took off with two crew members from South Kuta, they noticed a kite in their path. With the kite string tangled around the main rotor, the helicopter lost control and quickly dropped about 40 metres down a cliff near Suluban Beach.

                   'There\’s a new global internet speed record — and it\’s about six million times faster than Australia\’s average. A team at Japan\’s National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) hit 402 terabits per second (tbps), breaking their previous record of 321 tbps, set in 2023. Australia\’s average internet speed pales in comparison, at about 66 megabits per second (mbps), according to Speedtest.net How fast is the world\’s fastest internet? One terabit is one trillion bits; so the speed the NICT team clocked would equate to 402,000,000 mbps. At that speed, 12,500 movies could be downloaded in about a second. "If the average world download speed is, let\’s say 100 mbps, then our data rate is indeed 4 million times faster than that," Ben Puttnam, NICT chief senior researcher, said. He said it\’s unlikely a 402 tbps connection would be used in a household. Instead, it would likely sit "in the core of a network" "So you could think of it as a big data pipe that could connect four million homes each using 100 mbps, for example," he said. If a 3 mbps connection is needed to stream a movie on Netflix, Puttnam said a 402 tbps connection could support 130 million simultaneous streams. Gamers could also expect a hitch-free virtual reality experience playing games like Baldur\’s Gate 3 or Call of Duty. How do Australian internet speeds compare internationally? According to Speedtest.net, the global average download speed for fixed broadband internet is 93.93 mbps. By that measure, this new record speed is a few million times faster than what most of us get in our homes in Australia. At 66.58 mbps, Australia is ranked 82 on SpeedTest\’s June index of fixed broadband speeds worldwide, behind Oman and Czechia and just above Uzbekistan. Australia performed better on mobile internet speeds — ranking 22 with 94.28 mbps, behind Croatia and Estonia. The global mobile internet speed average is 56.43 mbps. Could Australian\’s ever have access to 402 tbps speds? Not anytime soon. While the recent world record was set using standard commercially available optical fibre, the speed test occurred in ideal lab conditions. Commercial deployment of technology that would enable such speeds won\’t be coming to an internet provider near you anytime soon. In addition to researchers from NICT, the record-setting team included academics from Aston University\’s Institute of Photonic Research in the UK and researchers from Nokia Bell Labs in the United States.',
                   'The United Nations\’ highest court said on Friday that Israel\’s occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements there are illegal and should be withdrawn as soon as possible, in its strongest findings to date on the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The advisory opinion by judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), known as the World Court, was not binding but carries weight under international law and may weaken support for Israel. Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and the regime associated with them, have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law," ICJ resident Nawaf Salam said, reading the findings of a 15-judge panel. The court said Israel\’s obligations include paying restitution for harm and "the evacuation of all settlers from existing settlements". In a swift reaction, Israel\’s foreign ministry rejected the opinion as "fundamentally wrong" and one-sided, and repeated its stance that a political settlement in the region can only be reached by negotiations. "The Jewish nation cannot be an occupier in its own land," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\’s office said in a statement. The opinion also angered West Bank settlers as well as politicians such as finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, whose nationalist religious party is close to the settler movement and who himself lives in a West Bank settlement. "The answer to The Hague - Sovereignty now" he said in a post on the social media platform X, in an apparent appeal to formally annex the West Bank. Israel Gantz, head of the Binyamin Regional Council, one of the largest settler councils, said the ICJ opinion was "contrary to the Bible, morality and international law". The ICJ opinion also found that the UN Security Council, the General Assembly and all states have an obligation not to recognise the occupation as legal nor "render aid or assistance" toward maintaining Israel\’s presence in the occupied territories. The Palestinian foreign ministry called the opinion "historic" and urged states to adhere to it. "No aid. No assistance. No complicity. No money, no arms, no trade...no actions of any kind to support Israel\’s illegal occupation," Palestinian envoy Riyad al-Maliki said outside the court in The Hague. The case stems from a 2022 request from the UN General Assembly, predating the Hamas-Israel war that began in October. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and has since built settlements in the West Bank and steadily expanded them. Israeli leaders argue the territories are not occupied in legal terms because they are on disputed lands, but the United Nations and most of the international community regard them as occupied territory. In February, more than 50 states presented their views before the court, with Palestinian representatives asking the court to find that Israel must withdraw from all the occupied areas and dismantle illegal settlements. Israel did not participate in the oral hearings but filed a written statement telling the court that issuing an advisory opinion would be "harmful" to attempts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The majority of states participating asked the court to find the occupation illegal, while a handful, including Canada and the United Kingdom, argued it should refuse to give an advisory opinion. The United States, which is Israel\’s biggest military ally and supporter, had asked the court not to order the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian territories. The US position was that the court should issue no decision that could hurt negotiations toward a two-state solution on a "land for peace" principle. In 2004 the ICJ gave an advisory ruling that an Israeli separation barrier around most of the West Bank was illegal and Israeli settlements were established in breach of international law. Israel dismissed that ruling.',
                   'When Cheryll and her partner were deciding whether to continue trying for a baby, they started to think about how their day-to-day life with a child would actually look. The couple from Brisbane don\’t yet own a home and  rents are rising. Cheryll, who did not want to use her full name, has to commute for one hour to get to work, and her partner travels two hours each way. "[We] can\’t move because we\’ve got a rental crisis [and] can\’t afford to rent close to work. Even then, there\’s no rentals available," the 35-year-old said. The couple were actively trying to get pregnant for around four years, eventually spending around $10,000 on in vitro fertilisation (IVF) despite going through the public health system. Both of them were diagnosed with conditions that made it more difficult for them to conceive, and Cheryll also had to spend around $10,000 for other health expenses including surgery to diagnose her endometriosis, which she did through the private system. The process was emotionally tough, Cheryll said. On top of that, the out-of-pocket cost of the treatments made them reassess whether it was financially viable for them to have kids. It just seemed like it was just going to be too stressful, like we weren\’t going to have a very good relationship with each other, or our kid. The couple lives paycheck-to-paycheck and Cheryll said she probably couldn\’t afford to take much maternity leave so her baby would have to be in child care from an early age. "Someone else would basically be raising our kid and there would be no room to actually enjoy being a parent," she said. Eventually, they decided to stop trying. While the decision was mainly due to the emotional toll, financial concerns "sealed the deal", she said. "You\’re not getting the results that you want but then you kind of go \’Is everything worth it?\’." Life feels too difficult for many young people considering parenthood. For young people weighing up the costs of having a baby, Australia can look "inhospitable to families", demographer Dr Liz Allen of the Australian National University (ANU) told SBS News. She said housing affordability, the rising cost of living, lack of secure employment, and concerns over the impacts of climate change, were all impacting young people\’s decisions on whether to have children and how many kids they could afford. "We know that young people are foregoing having children because they can\’t afford it," Allen said. The number of live births per woman in Australia is around 1.7, lower than the 2.1 babies required to maintain a constant population size over the long term without migration. She said many young people were only wanting one or two children because life felt too difficult or uncertain. "That uncertainty is going to undermine our security and potentially our democracy into the future," she said. "We\’ve created a system that is inhospitable to families and the future of this country, that must be changed." We\’ve created a system that is inhospitable to families and the future of this country, that must be changed. Former NSW resident Amy, who is in her early 30s and now living in the United Kingdom, says she is frustrated that older generations believe the "traditional timeline" is still achievable. "My generation have taken 10-plus years longer to break into the housing market, and five-plus years longer to find a life partner," she told SBS News. She said she had worked hard in her 20s and so had her partner. "Neither of us feel we\’ve had the time to be financially stable adults who can enjoy our adulthood before having kids." My generation have taken 10-plus years longer to break into the housing market, and five-plus years longer to find a life partner. Amy, former NSW resident She said the couple wanted a comfortable home, financial stability and enough money to go on a couple of holidays a year. "Inflation and the cost of living make these small dreams impossible for so many," she said. "I\’d want my child to have the childhood I was given but we can\’t afford that." She said her parents had married at 21 years old, bought a house and had three children. "I married a year ago at age 30 and we\’re still renting." People need to feel confident about their jobs KPMG urban economist Terry Rawnsley said fertility rates were often linked to economic cycles. "People want to have confidence that both they, [and] their partner, have jobs and those jobs will be around for a while." He agreed that housing affordability was also likely "crimping" the fertility rate. "If you live in a two-bedroom unit in Sydney, and that\’s what you can afford, having one child makes logistical sense," he said. "But having two children — it\’s much harder to do that in a two-bedroom apartment [and] you might not be able to afford a three-bedroom townhouse." Rawnsley said cities that were more expensive to live in, such as Sydney, had lower birth rates, compared to more affordable cities like Brisbane. He said improving fertility rates in Australia could ease the reliance on migrants in the long term, although it would not do anything to address current labour shortages. Australia is one of around 50 countries and areas, where immigration is projected to be the main driver of population growth through to 2100. Other countries include Canada and the United States. Relying on immigration to boost the proportion of working-age people in the country was not necessarily a problem, but it did make issues around housing affordability more likely, Rawnsley said. He also said there were also potential risks around relying on migration. "The whole world is ageing — and there\’s just more and more competition for skilled migrants across the world," he said. Allen said policies in Australia needed to better reflect the current reality young people were living, rather than the 1950s model of a family with a male breadwinner. "We need to be able to support families no matter what they look like, to survive and to thrive," she said. "That cannot mean that the only way to survive and the only way to make ends meet is to have a dual income [of] $150,000 each to break into the property market." Allen said Australia should stop relying on the market to fix things like housing affordability. "We\’ve relied on business entities and the private market to control these things; government need to take more steps to consider what can be done." This could include removing tax incentives for property speculation to make it easier for people to buy a home, rather than renting. She said rental rights also needed to be improved as home ownership was getting more difficult. Promoting gender equality was also important, Allen said, as women were still doing the largest share of unpaid work and were also being asked to participate in the paid workforce. "We\’re asking women to do it all," she said. "But actually, we\’re saying [that] in order to have it all, you literally have to do it all, and we\’re not seeing men step up." If women "want it all", they are expected to do it all, experts say. She said workplaces and society in general should be more supportive of gender equality so that both men and women could have a family if they wanted without compromising on their own identity. This includes supporting men to be the primary caregiver if they want, she said.  "[Then] we can ensure a healthy population, a healthy workforce and healthy ageing, to ensure that we have a future worth living." Reality of having children does not appeal Amy said she didn\’t see many examples of mothers her age who seemed truly happy. "They lose themselves to it and are quite depressed as a result," she said. "They also hold a lot of resentment for their partners and I\’d rather a marriage where we\’re equal, happy and fulfilled as we are." Cheryll and her partner had only just finished paying off the debt from their medical bills, and have decided to embrace not having a child. She is now co-hosting a podcast about being childless called Barrenesses. "I feel good about that decision," she said about quitting fertility treatments. "But I don\’t really feel good about how the government keeps telling us to have kids but they don\’t really want to look at the reality of how hard it is for people."',
                   'A global technology outage on Friday grounded flights, disrupted health services, crashed payment systems and blocked access to Microsoft services in what experts believe is one of the largest IT failures in history. The cause of the disruptions originated from a cybersecurity firm called CrowdStrike, which provides software to a wide range of industries. An update to one of CrowdStrike\’s pieces of software, Falcon Sensor, malfunctioned, throwing a wrench into computers running Windows, leading to major tech failures around the world, the company said. Here\’s what we know about the outage so far. What is CrowdStrike? CrowdStrike is an American cybersecurity firm founded in 2011 and based in Austin, Texas. Since its inception, the company has grown rapidly as it began to offer a range of security services using cloud-based software. It has raised millions in funding from Silicon Valley powerhouses such as Google\’s venture capital arm. It employs thousands of workers and services businesses in countries across the globe, boasting on its website that it protects 538 out of the Fortune 1000 companies. The firm has become immensely successful over the past decade, with a market value of around $83bn at market close on Thursday, though its stock price was falling during Friday trading. CrowdStrike\’s share value declined dramatically following the outage, dipping as much as 13% early on Friday. While the company\’s primary products are intended to block hackers and malware, CrowdStrike has also been hired to investigate major data breaches. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 tasked CrowdStrike with investigating the Russian hack of DNC servers, while Sony Pictures employed the company to look into a 2014 cyberattack linked to North Korea. CrowdStrike\’s investigation into the DNC hack also previously played a small but notable role in the first impeachment of Donald Trump and special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump, echoing a widely repudiated conspiracy theory that CrowdStrike was involved in an elaborate cover up on behalf of the DNC, nonsensically suggested the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, look into the company, a piece of the quid pro quo accusations against the US president. How did CrowdStrike cause the global outage? The global outage stems from an update CrowdStrike made to its marquee cybersecurity platform, a cloud-based software product called Falcon. When CrowdStrike pushed an update to the Falcon software, which interacts with other parts of computer systems and software like Microsoft\’s Windows products, it caused a malfunction that essentially disabled those systems and their widely used pieces of software the world over. Put bluntly, the software intended to protect against crashes and disruptions in vital computer systems ended up taking them down. CrowdStrike\’s CEO, George Kurtz, has apologized for the outage, which the company has stated was due to a faulty piece of code. “This is not a security incident or cyberattack. The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed,” Kurtz wrote on Twitter. “We refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website.” Compounding the chaos on Friday, another outage also hit Microsoft\’s Azure cloud services and caused an additional set of failures. Microsoft has stated that the two outages were unrelated, and that its Azure services were now back online. Kurtz meanwhile told NBC\’s Today show that it could be “some time” before systems fully recover from the outage his company caused.',
                   'After conducting more than 200 interviews and combing through his phone and internet search history, federal investigators have pieced together an early portrait of the man who sought to assassinate former President Donald Trump: Thomas Matthew Crooks was an intelligent, unassuming loner, who expressed an interest in guns and was far from outspoken about politics. But the emerging profile of Crooks nearly a week after the shooting has left authorities puzzled about a motive for his assault and has had investigators speculating that his intentions may have been less politically motivated and more about attacking the highest-profile target near him. The investigation remains in its early stages, officials caution. Still, in some ways, Crooks seems similar to the dozens of other young men who\’ve wreaked havoc across the US with high-powered assault-style rifles in recent years. He had few close friends, he would often go shooting at a local firing range, and he didn\’t seem to display strongly held views that would suggest a politically driven assassination, according to CNN interviews with law enforcement and a review of notes from a briefing to Congress. In addition to the former president, Crooks had searched online about President Joe Biden and had photos on his phone of other prominent figures from both parties. He searched for the location of Trump\’s rally as well as the upcoming Democratic National Convention, the briefing notes say, and discovered that Trump planned to appear just an hour\’s drive away from his home in the Pittsburgh suburbs. That suggests Crooks may have been looking to carry out a high-profile shooting, and the Trump event\’s proximity and timing offered the most accessible opportunity, federal officials have speculated. “Even though he didn\’t get his primary target, the shooter was successful in a lot of ways because he got closer to doing something no one has done in decades,” one federal official told CNN, referring to the assassination of a presidential candidate. It remains unclear if Crooks intended to carry out a much larger attack and started with Trump because that was the way to gain the most notoriety. Crooks had also searched for information on another recent mass shooter who shot and killed four classmates at a Michigan high school in 2021. The web searches about that shooter, Ethan Crumbley, are consistent with what law enforcement officials have seen in other mass shooters who research people they wish to emulate, in part, as a way to form their own idea of how to do something bigger, the federal official said. But there are also significant differences between Crooks\’ behavior and that of a typical mass shooter. On the day of the attack, Crooks appeared to have been specifically targeting Trump – not aiming at the crowds in an attempt to kill as many people as possible. While he had an improvised explosive in the trunk of his car, it\’s not clear if he planned to set it off to kill people or as a distraction. Kathleen Puckett, a former FBI behavioral analyst who worked on the case of the “Unabomber” Ted Kaczynski, said that Crooks also appeared to have less firepower than many mass shooters, who often carry multiple weapons and wear body armor. “It didn\’t look to me like he was ready for an assault,” Puckett said, while noting the limits of publicly available information. “It looked to me like he was taking a window that he saw a vulnerability in where he felt that he was unobserved to the extent he could get off some critical shots.” In addition, unlike other mass shooters who often leave behind writings to explain their attacks, authorities have thus far recovered few clues, in Crooks\’ bedroom or online. That is frustrating experts who are trying to piece together his mindset – and raising comparisons with Stephen Paddock, the gunman who killed 60 people in Las Vegas in 2017. Nearly seven years after America\’s deadliest mass shooting, investigators still do not know why Paddock pulled the trigger. Like the Las Vegas massacre, “this may be a situation where the more we know, the less we understand about the exact reason why,” said Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security and a CNN national security analyst. Crooks\’ family members told investigators he did not openly discuss politics, and evidence recovered at his home shed no further light on his political values or ideology, according to a readout shared with CNN that details a briefing that FBI and US Secret Service officials gave lawmakers Wednesday. Mary Ellen O\’Toole, a former FBI profiler, said that based on the evidence assembled so far, she thought that Trump\’s rally was “very appealing” to Crooks in part because it “fell in his backyard.” “This gave him incredible attention and catapulted him to a point where I think that\’s why he chose this,” she speculated. Still, Puckett called lone offenders – who largely remain invisible before attacks – “one of the prickliest problems out there” for law enforcement, and warned against a rush to find simple answers about Crooks\’ motive. “Whatever his story turns out to be, it\’s not going to be simplistic, I don\’t think – it\’s going to be more complicated,” Puckett said. “You don\’t want the simplistic version. You want every detail you can find.”',
                   'Years ago, some people would spend hours at Starbucks. Today, it\’s a takeout counter. At many Starbucks locations, you\’re lucky to find anyone sitting down. Under Howard Schultz, Starbucks\’ longtime leader, cafes were positioned as a “third place” between work and home, where people could linger for hours on plush purple armchairs, socialize and connect. “If you look at the landscape of retail and restaurants in America, there is such a fracturing of places where people meet,” Schultz said in a 1995 profile of Starbucks for an industry publication. “There\’s nowhere for people to go. So we created a place where people can feel comfortable.” The idea of Starbucks as a third place became part of its corporate mythology. Starbucks aimed to create a welcoming environment for coffee drinkers and employees with comfortable seating, jazz music and the aroma of freshly-brewed coffee. Employees who brewed and served Starbucks coffee, whom Starbucks called baristas, handwrote customers\’ names on their drink orders. By the time Michelle Eisen joined Starbucks in 2010 as an employee in Buffalo, New York, her store was always packed during the holidays with people meeting friends and family. She witnessed first dates and helped a customer\’s propose to his spouse, writing “will you marry me?” on a cup. “It was a cheerful, amazing thing to be part of it,” she said of working at Starbucks and forming close relationships with customers. “It\’s why so many employees stayed for so long.” Eisen has helped lead Starbucks Workers United, a group unionizing company stores. But Starbucks\’ business has transformed, and it has struggled to maintain its identity as that third place along the way. Mobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks\’ sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States. In some stores, customers complained online that Starbucks pulled out comfortable chairs and replaced them with hard wooden stools. Starbucks has also built pickup-only stores without seating. Machines that print customers\’ names have replaced baristas\’ handwriting on cups. “Third place is a broader definition,” current Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said last year. The “classic definition of third place — it\’s a box where I go to meet someone — it\’s frankly not relevant anymore in this context.” Starbucks\’ sales in its home North America market dropped 3% last quarter. Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks\’ CEO (for a third time) and retired from Starbucks\’ board of directors last year, wrote a lengthy message on LinkedIn in May about the company\’s issues. “U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company\’s fall from grace. The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience,” he said. The company needs to “focus on being experiential, not transactional.” Starbucks\’ changes to its sit-down business model came in response to several trends — demand from customers for ordering coffee from their cars in drive-thru lanes or on their smartphones. The shift from a business serving hot coffee to one in which cold coffees, teas and lemonades make up more than half of sales. The Covid-19 pandemic, which forced cafes to shut indoor seating. Starbucks shifted to meet Wall Street\’s demands, too. Starbucks found it could reduce labor costs and increase order volume by running a mostly drive-thru and take-away coffee business. Starbucks also found difficulties with being America\’s third place and did not want to become the public space and bathroom for everyone, including people coming into stores who were homeless or struggling with mental health challenges on city streets. Starbucks has closed some stores and restricted bathroom access over safety concerns. But by prioritizing speed — “throughput” in corporate parlance — Starbucks hurt the appeal of sitting down for coffee in stores, some critics say. “Their success has not enabled them to retain what people originally found so attractive about the brand,” said Tom Cook, a principal at restaurant consultancy King-Casey who has worked with Starbucks. “It\’s turned into a transaction business that has very little interpersonal interaction and engagement.” Many Starbucks\’ stores feel more like a fast-food restaurant than a coffee shop, Cook said. “They had this unique image and personality. That doesn\’t exist anymore.” Starbucks\’ shift from a sit-down shop to a primarily drive-thru and mobile pickup business has been gradual. The company was hesitant to build out drive-thru stores during the 1990s, fearing they would take away from the third place appeal. “We don\’t want to become just another commodity product,” Starbucks finance chief Michael Casey said in the 1995 profile of the company. “The drive-thrus are a way for the converted to get their coffee a little quicker. It\’s not the way we want people to discover the Starbucks experience.” But Starbucks warmed to the option, finding that many customers preferred the convenience of drive-thrus on their way to work. By 2005, nearly 15% of Starbucks\’ roughly 7,300 stores were drive-thru locations. For the first time that year, more than half of new Starbucks stores were drive-thru locations. Today, 70% of Starbucks locations have a drive-thru option. Mobile ordering was another major step in Starbucks\’ road to becoming primarily a take-away business. In 2014, Starbucks debuted its mobile ordering system, which allowed customers to place pickup orders from their smartphones without having to interact with an employee. Mobile ordering also gave the company more data on consumers and helped push them to Starbucks\’ loyalty program, benefiting Starbucks because loyalty members are its most profitable customers. Mobile ordering surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when Starbucks was required to temporarily close seating areas inside to customers to prevent the virus\’ spread. Mobile orders jumped from 17% of sales in early 2020 to 26% the following year. Although mobile ordering has been popular with busy customers and investors, growing to more than 30% of sales today, it has taken away from the sit-down experience, analysts say. Starbucks baristas have complained about the crush of additional orders coming in from mobile orders and struggles to keep up with demand. People enter and exit stores more frequently, opening and closing the door and letting in the cold or heat. Mobile ordering “commoditized” Starbucks by leading it to focus on order volume and efficiency, said Joe Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons who wrote a recent article about Starbucks\’ struggles in Harvard Business Review. Starbucks\’ menu changes also had an impact on this shift. Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say. Starbucks says that it\’s evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling. In 2022, Starbucks said it was “reimagining the third place” by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks\’ mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks. Starbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations. Eisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down. The best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said. That means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders. “If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,” she said. “That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.”',
                   'The loss of rural school bus routes has left locals in one Hawke\’s Bay settlement furious at what they say is a lack of consultation from the Government, with some students now questioning whether to continue their education. Te Pōhue is around a 40 minute drive from Napier. Following a Ministry of Education review, nine rural bus runs will stop and three others will be restructured that take students to Napier and Hastings. Mum Michelle Codd told 1News the move could hurt her children\’s educational future. "You can\’t expect me to drive my son you know realistically two hours a day into town and then drive back home and then go to work ... and then do it all again in the afternoon," she said. "They\’re making me decide whether or not my 17-year-old daughter goes back for last year because we don\’t have that bus now." "If I don\’t mind using a bit of language, I\’m bloody angry," another local told 1News. Johnella Condon Orr said the decision was "just disappointing". "Our rural communities depend on them, especially if our kids can\’t go to a boarding school." The Ministry of Education said it only provides buses as a last resort and the students in Te Pōhue are either not going to their nearest school or have other transport available. According to the ministry, William Colenso College in Napier is the closest for Te Pōhue students. However, Napier\’s other schools, where students are currently enrolled, are only a few minutes further away. "Policy requires us to deliver service only to eligible students, so we apply a range of eligibility criteria," the ministry\’s James Meffan explained. "Wherever we draw a line ... some people will not win and others will. It\’s always disappointing to be on the wrong side of that line." Out of approximately 1400 ministry-contracted daily bus routes across the country, 1News can reveal that 130 have been reviewed since the beginning of Term 1 this year. The nine Hastings bus routes alone affect more than 350 students. Hastings Mayor Sandra Hazlehurst was unhappy with the lack of consultation. She said the Education Ministry should speak with communities and work out effective solutions for a school transport system, rather than making "blanket cuts for the sake of it". "I\’d like the ministry to come out to our communities and talk with us to see how we can find a solution and how we can get our children to school," she said. Meffan said because the eligibility criteria is very clear, the ministry isn\’t consulting in the sense of asking permission to carry out the changes. Codd said her only option at this stage was to put the issue back on the Education Ministry. "Tell me what you want me to do with my son." The nine affected bus routes will continue until the end of the year.',
                   'Indira Stewart reflects for the re_covering podcast on the "huge sacrifice" of training as a journalist while a solo mum-of-two on benefit. Indira Stewart is now one of Aotearoa\’s best-known and most-respected journalists, having occupied top reporting and presenting roles at the likes of TVNZ and Radio New Zealand over the last decade. But rewind to the early 2010s, and the successful career she now enjoys looks like a distant dream. Known back then as the impressive Tongan-Fijian singer who had finished runner-up in the 2006 series of New Zealand Idol, Stewart\’s life was turned upside-down as she navigated raising two children solo while surviving on a combination of singing gigs and benefit payments. In an illuminating interview with Media Chaplaincy/RNZ podcast re_covering released on Wednesday, Stewart lifted the lid on that “dark time in my life”, and the sacrifices she made to pursue journalism when the odds were stacked so heavily against her. “I walked out of a marriage at 26, divorced, with two young kids under two on my back,” she told media chaplain and re_covering host Rev Frank Ritchie. “I went through this season of really digging deep. I\’d been a people pleaser all my life, and it [this experience] made me not give a f**k about what people thought about me, which was a really raw place for me to find some courage to figure out who I was and reinvent myself.” That reinvention began with the pursuit of a different career. “I had gone down paths that were kind of formed for me – I went to uni to do music. It wasn\’t until after New Zealand Idol, doing TV for that time, that I thought, \’oh, I actually might enjoy this\’. So I went back to uni and started Communications at AUT.” Stewart reflects now that the decision was something of a return to the natural skillset she\’d demonstrated throughout her childhood. “I think I was actually always supposed to be a storyteller. From a very young age, I always had the tea on what was happening in the neighbourhood… I remember my Dad saying, \’You\’ll be a very good news reporter, you\’re good at gossiping\’. “When I was 15, Tagata Pasifika auditioned high school kids to report on the ASB Polynesian Festival, and I did the events for a couple of years and loved it. But because I\’d never seen a Tongan woman like myself on a mainstream platform, it was never even an idea that it could be a career for me.” While returning to university was the right decision, Stewart told re_covering making it work on a practical level was “very, very hard”. “I had two kids, I was on a benefit. Even just affording bus money to get to uni classes was a huge sacrifice. It\’d be either milk and nappies, or catch a bus and go to class. “There were very many days that you were hungry, and some days my dinner was whatever my kids had left over. That\’s just what the reality was, but I am so proud to have got through that. “I think the thing that always drove me was that I had reasons that were bigger than myself, which were my kids… This might sound a bit weird to people, but I probably wouldn\’t be here today if I just thought about myself. My kids were such a huge motivation to be someone better.” Despite her success in journalism in the years since then, Stewart hasn\’t forgotten her roots and has regularly used her platform to give a voice to Pasifika people and marginalised groups, whose stories too often go unheard. Last year, her story about high school students who were at school full-time, but also working the equivalent of full-time hours to support their families, sent shockwaves through the country and infused humanity into election cycle debates about poverty. Asked about her hopes for the future of journalism, Stewart told Rev Ritchie she wanted to do her bit helping repair public trust in media, which is now “well below” the global average, according to a 2024 report by the AUT Research Centre for Journalism, Media and Democracy. Stewart says while there are arguments to be made about why media is more trustworthy than it\’s perceived to be, she doesn\’t “discredit anyone feeling the way that they do” about it. She says growing up, she too didn\’t trust the media herself because she saw harmful narratives about brown people being perpetuated. “But there are also reasons many of us came to work in this industry: because we believe in the diversity of voices, the diversity of perspectives, and we believe in the truth being told,” she said. Stewart says the values instilled in her through her strong Christian faith has heavily shaped her reporting. “Growing up, I was always told about Isaiah 61. It talks about being anointed to preach the good news to the poor, to set the captives free, to bind the brokenhearted. And that\’s always been a huge value for me, not just in my life, but in journalism. “When we talk about preaching the good news, the good news to us is the gospel, and we were told the gospel of truth. When I take that scripture and apply it to my career, I think I\’m called to preach the truth… and the truth sets people free.” “When I\’ve thought about the young kids who have told me truths – whether it\’s having to work long hours, or suffering from some horrific abuse – that\’s the kind of truth that has set so many other people free.” Stewart says there are risks associated with truth-telling, but believes it\’s the most effective way for news outlets to win back the public\’s trust. “The truth is hard to hear, not everyone likes it. Some of the stories I\’ve done, I\’ve had major backlash with people not wanting those abuse stories to be told, people threatening my safety,” she said. “But if I let fear drive my career and drive the stories that I told, 85% of my career would be out the door. You have to be courageous to tell the truth.” In a wide-ranging interview, Stewart discusses her determination to be a role model to the next generation of Pasifika women, presenting the last ever 1News Midday bulletin, and reflects on her upbringing.']

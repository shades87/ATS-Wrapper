    articleText = ['Bad actors seizing on Microsoft IT outage to scam public, Clare O’Neil warns Home affairs minister says small businesses should be cautious of emails from people posing as CrowdStrike or Microsoft Scammers are attempting to use the global CrowdStrike outage on Microsoft Windows systems to steal from small businesses by offering fake fixes, the Australian government has warned. The world has begun to recover from a global outage of Windows systems running the cybersecurity company Crowdstrike’s software, after the company issued a faulty update. But bad actors have seized upon the crisis to attempt to scam the public, the home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, said on Saturday. “What we are seeing some reporting of is attempts to conduct phishing through the incident that just occurred,” she said. She said small businesses in particular were receiving emails from people pretending to be CrowdStrike or Microsoft and seeking bank details to access a reboot to fix the error. “I ask Australians to be really cautious over the next few days about attempts to use this for scamming or phishing,” she said. “If you see an email, if you see a text message that looks a little bit funny, that indicates something about CrowdStrike or IT outages, just stop. Don’t put any details.” She said if people receive calls along those lines they should hang up, and if people do hand over their banking information then to contact their bank immediately to report it. “This is a moment where we can help our fellow Australian citizens. If someone has tried to scam you, they are trying to scam others,” she said. “You can help protect your fellow citizens by jumping online, going to the Scamwatch website and just report back what’s happened so we can make sure that the government can continue to alert people as we move forward.” The Australian Cyber Security Centre warned on Saturday that a number of malicious websites and “unofficial code” were being released, claiming to help businesses recover from the outage. The centre said it “strongly encourages all consumers to source their technical information and updates from official CrowdStrike sources only”. CrowdStrike’s own threat intelligence reported that malicious activity includes phishing emails posing as CrowdStrike support or independent researchers selling scripts to automate recovery from the issue. The organisation identified more than 30 domains that had been used in the scams so far. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission deputy chair, Catriona Lowe, warned the public not to download unsolicited software and to be wary of any unsolicited calls or emails. Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters “Criminals look to take advantage of incidents like this CrowdStrike outage, creating a sense of urgency that you need to do what they say to protect your computer and your financial information,” Lowe said. “Anyone can be scammed, so it is important to be wary of any unsolicited contact that purports to provide assistance in the aftermath of a major event like this.” O’Neil said the Australian economy was in a recovery phase after Friday’s outage, but there would still be teething problems for some businesses in bringing their services back online.',
                   'The Wallabies survived a scare to keep their unbeaten run under Joe Schmidt alive with a hard-earned 40-29 victory over Georgia in Sydney. The 12th-ranked Georgians threatened to spring a surprise after closing to within two points of the hosts early in the second half before the Wallabies kicked away late at Allianz Stadium on Saturday. Schmidt made 10 changes to the side that beat Wales 36-28 last Saturday in Melbourne and some seized the opportunity, while others didn’t. New flyhalf Ben Donaldson didn’t look the answer to Australia’s playmaking dilemma, his kicking and decision-making too often poor. The Wallabies had the tireless back row of Fraser McReight, Rob Valetini and Harry Wilson largely to thank for helping secure three straight wins for the national side for the first time since 2021 when under Dave Rennie. Lock Nick Frost and first-time starting prop Isaac Kailea were also strong but the first-half dismissal of winger Filipo Daugunu for a dangerous tackle made life difficult for the home side. Daugunu’s initial yellow card for kneeing Georgian winger Demur Tapladze in the head while airborne and trying to charge down a kick was elevated to a red at half-time. The disruption didn’t help Schmidt’s new-look outfit as they struggled to put the spirited eastern Europeans away. Still, the Wallabies looked to have the game wrapped up with a 26-10 lead into the break. After falling behind to a second-minute penalty goal to impressive Georgia five-eighth Luka Matkava, the Wallabies crossed for three tries in 15 minutes through centre Hunter Paisami, Valetini and Kailea. Then the hosts lost their way. Ill-discipline and Daugunu’s departure invited the eastern Europeans back into the contest as Georgia reduced the deficit to 19-10 with a 33rd-minute converted try to lock Micheil Babunashvili. Only a driving maul try to man of the match McReight on the stroke of half-time gave the Wallabies some breathing space. And it didn’t last long as Georgia closed to within two points of Australia with two scintillating tries early in the second half through fullback Davit Niniashvili and lightning winger Akaki Tabutsadze. For all their pluck and resilience, the tide turned back in the Wallabies’ favour after Georgia themselves were reduced to 14 men with the sin-binning of Niniashvili for a deliberate knock down as Australia pounded their line. A McReight break and 40-metre burst set up Valetini’s second try and there was no coming back from The Lelos. McReight completed his own try double to restore Australia’s 16-point advantage before Tabutsadze crossed for a consolation second five-pointer late on. Schmidt, conceding pre-match it was difficult to strike a balance between building depth and winning, will take the victory. But after Eddie Jones’ side downed Georgia by 20 points during last year’s ill-fated World Cup campaign, the new coach will also recognise the Wallabies need to improve markedly for their Rugby Championship opener against the top-ranked Springboks in Brisbane on 10 August.',
                   'You’ve likely heard of Project 2025. It’s a set of conservative policy recommendations written by a right-wing policy group for the next U.S. Republican President. Democrats have attacked Trump’s ties to the plan as some advisers from his first term have been involved. However, Trump has publicly distanced himself from it. Here’s what you need to know. Project 2025 is organised by a right-wing policy group, The Heritage Foundation. It’s helped shape the policies of Republican Presidents since Ronald Reagan won in 1981. They claim two-thirds of its recommendations have been implemented. The Heritage Foundation says Project 2025 will undo “the damage the Left has wrought” through immigration, abortion, defence, tax, and education policies. It has four main pillars: a policy agenda, a personnel database, a “Presidential Administration Academy”, and a 180-Day Playbook. 1. The Policy Agenda is the 900-page document that contains a series of policy proposals to “rescue [the U.S.] from the grip of the radical left” and to dismantle the “woke left”. On immigration, the group wants to dismantle the current Department of Homeland Security and reorganise most national security agencies to strengthen the country’s border policing operation. It wants to increase funding for a wall on the U.S-Mexico border, saying the border should be “sealed.” On healthcare, Project 2025 says it prioritises “protecting life, conscience, and bodily integrity.” It wants to see the abortion pill mifepristone pulled from the market and greater restrictions imposed. It states: “Abortion and euthanasia are not health care.” On climate change, the group says while it supports “creating a better environmental tomorrow”, the Government needs to “stop the war on oil and natural gas.” It wants to slash funding for renewable energy completely. 2. The Personnel Database registry allows supporters of the movement to build professional profiles to create a streamlined hiring process. 3. A “Presidential Administration Academy” would provide future political employees with the education and skillset to advance the movement once in the White House. 4. The 180-Day Playbook details a concrete plan for Trump’s first six months and proposes instructions for federal agencies on their first course of action, if he wins. Trump claims he “knows nothing” about Project 2025, and has called some of the policies “absolutely ridiculous and abysmal”. However, many of his closest policy advisers are involved. Russell T. Vought, Trump’s former Director of the Office of Management and Budget, authored one of the plan’s chapters. Stephen Miller, a former Trump adviser who’s expected to return to the White House if Trump wins, has been associated with a legal team on Project 2025’s advisory board. Although Trump has set his own agenda clear in a 16-page document on his website, critics have spotted similarities between Project 2025 and his policies. For example, one of Trump’s immigration policies is to “seal the border and stop the migrant invasion”. Trump says he also “proudly stands for families and life.” He is against “late-term abortion”, but says he endorses birth control and IVF. Trump wants the U.S. to be “the Number One Producer” of oil and natural gas. Democratic President Joe Biden continues to accuse Trump of having deep ties with Project 2025, saying it’s “run and paid for by Trump people”. At a campaign rally in Michigan over the weekend, Biden warned American voters that Project 2025 is the “biggest attack on our system of government and our personal freedom that has ever been proposed in the history of this country.”',
                   'At least 19 people have died during student-led protests in Bangladesh. Anti-government rallies have caused chaos in parts of the country’s capital Dhaka, as students call for a jobs quota system to be scrapped. Under the system, more than 30% of public service jobs in Bangladesh are reserved for families of veterans who served in the country’s war of independence. Protesters, who have been gathering at university campuses, have called the quotas “discriminatory”. In 1971, East and West Pakistan fought in a war that ended with the creation of an independent Bangladesh. Shortly after independence, then-leader Sheikh Mujibur Rehman introduced a quota system for public service jobs — around one in three roles were reserved for soldiers who served in the Bangladesh independence war, and their relatives. The quota system was in place until 2018, when similar protests led to its suspension. The country’s High Court reinstated it last month. This month, tens of thousands of students have led protests calling for an end to the public service quota. Protesters are calling for the system to be overhauled, so staff are appointed to public service roles based on merit, not heritage. Student-led blockades and protests have spread across several cities in Bangladesh, including Chattogram and Rangpur. Demonstrators have blocked roads in the capital, Dhaka, prompting an escalation of violence and clashes with security officials. Riot police have been deployed to shut down protests. Footage shows police using tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds. Internet and mobile services have been cut off in some parts of the country. Clashes between police and students killed at least 19 people. Some media reports estimate the death toll is higher. Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina has condemned the violence. In a televised address, she announced there would be a “judicial investigation” into the protest and incidents of violence. She also said the country’s top court, the Supreme Court, is weighing up the future of the quota system and is expected to hand down a decision next month. United Nations Human Rights chief, Volker Türk, has urged Bangladesh officials to engage with protesters. “Freedom of expression & peaceful assembly are fundamental human rights,” he posted on X. The U.S. Embassy in Dhaka has temporarily closed to the public due to security concerns. Australia has updated its travel advice to “exercise a high degree of caution” for Bangladesh, citing widespread unrest.',
                   'Inside a vault of this data centre is what looks like a hotel for computers. It\'s noisy and hot. Each of these blinking server racks belongs to a business or an organisation. They house their critical infrastructure and data here because it\'s highly secure – with layers of security including ID checks and fingerprints just to get in. "Whether that\'s networking or just general computer infrastructure," David Dzienciol, chief customer and commercial officer of NEXTDC, told The Business inside a data hall. "We run 14 data centres across the country, servicing customers from the largest multinationals, through to Australia\'s largest companies all the way through to small business. "We rely on technology for everything, whether it\'s our health care, banking services or government services. "There\'s no industry that isn\'t reliant on data today." Australia is one of the top five data centre hubs in the world. There are 214 data centres spread across the country, according to the Australian Information Industry Association. With the explosion of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, the industry is expected to grow exponentially. "We believe that we are at the beginning of a massive shift with AI," Mr Dzienciol said. "We truly believe that we\'re at the beginning of a change in accelerated computing that could see demand skyrocket over the next decade." Data centres are already big power users in Australia. They need significant amounts of electricity to run high-intensity computing and cooling systems. Just one large data centre can consume the same amount of energy required to power 50,000 homes. Morgan Stanley estimates that data centres are currently using 5 per cent (1,050 MW) of the electricity on Australia\'s power grid and that is expected to grow to 8 per cent (2,500 MW) by 2030. Some estimates even suggest they could require up to 15 per cent of the power on the grid by then. As the nation races to electrify, with households dumping gas appliances and more people driving electric vehicles, the grid is already under pressure from rising demand. The Australian Energy Market Operator\'s latest Integrated Systems Plan anticipates overall electricity consumption from the grid to nearly double by 2050. The director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, Bruce Mountain, said Australia was not well placed to cope with that increasing demand. "We are now hitting the difficult stages of the energy transition," Professor Mountain told The Business. "We\'ve got wind and sun and land, but we don\'t have other clean energy, biomass or decent amounts of hydro or nuclear. "And that\'s a disadvantage that we face that other countries don\'t face." Professor Mountain thinks although the data centre sector is a vital service to Australia\'s economy, the boom will make the energy transition more challenging. "They make the transition challenge harder, because not just that you need to replace coal-fired generation, you need to build new capacity to meet rising demand," he said. "It\'s not yet an insurmountable problem, but if the demand continues to escalate at the rate it has, based on the recent developments, I think it is an issue." The director of the Energy Program at Grattan Institute, Tony Wood, agreed that the sector presents a unique challenge to the grid. "That means putting pressure on our electricity grid. It means even putting pressure on our greenhouse gas emissions," he said. "If you add a lot more demand, and you don\'t add more supply, then prices go up. "I think governments can get on top of this, but now is the time to be doing it.  Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the first auction of the Capacity Investment Scheme, which will support 6GW of new power, has received more than 40GW of project registrations, showing there is a strong pipeline of renewables ready to go. Energy retailer and generator Origin supplies power to about a third of all data centres in Australia. The man in charge of these accounts said the company was looking at a range of options to meet their needs. "Typically, we will look at solutions like distributed generation, so wind or solar at site, storage solutions and backup generation, and using energy from the grid as well," James Magill, head of Origin Zero, told The Business. "Our customers, with their forecasts, would vary somewhat, but typically, those growth forecasts could be between about 10 and 30 per cent per year." Mr Magill said to meet those energy demands, companies could be strategic about where they build data centres.',
                   'After eight years of financial heartbreak and court battles, the liquidator of Clive Palmer\'s former Queensland Nickel refinery says it has paid the company\'s creditors in full.  The Yabulu Nickel Refinery, owned by Queensland Nickel Industries, was the Townsville region\'s largest private employer when it collapsed in 2016, owing hundreds of millions of dollars. More than 700 workers lost their jobs. Liquidator FTI announced yesterday that outstanding creditors had been paid $300 million — a full settlement of claims, it said. FTI senior managing director Kelly Trenfield said when FTI was first appointed, it estimated QNI owed about $800 million. Many of those claims had been settled, removed or reduced over the past eight years. She said recovering the final $300 million owed to creditors had been a long process. "The thing that really got us was the number of people who were directly impacted, whether they were employees or direct suppliers," she said. "We were made very keenly aware of people\'s emotional involvement, there were employees who had worked there for decades." FTI said it had distributed federal government payments of $70 million to nearly all 787 former QNI employees. There were about 1,500 creditors in total, including local infrastructure suppliers including rail, power and ports, according to Ms Trenfield. In 2019, the Townsville City Council launched legal action to recover $2.5 million from QNI Metals Propriety Limited and QNI Resources, claiming the companies had not paid their rates or charges at the Yabalu refinery or a property since 2016. A spokesperson for the council confirmed yesterday that payment for outstanding rates and charges was received in August 2020. Queensland Nickel\'s liquidators had pursued Mr Palmer\'s companies since the QNI collapse, prompting lengthy court battles with the billionaire. Ms Trenfield said the largest amount of money recovered was $102 million, from Mr Palmer\'s company Mineralogy. She said there were court proceedings to be finalised before the liquidation could conclude, but indicated the end was in sight. "It\'s so nice to see a complete payment back to creditors even if it has taken eight years," she said. In 2022, Mr Palmer sold the Yabulu refinery to Swiss buyers, sparking hope the refinery would be fired back up within 18 months.  But the future of the operation remains unclear. Monash University critical minerals researcher Professor David Whittle said any company looking to revive the operation faced an uphill battle. Earlier this month, mining giant BHP announced it was putting its WA nickel mines on ice for at least three years, blaming an "oversupply in the global nickel market. Professor Whittle said Australian nickel producers faced increasing competition from low-cost producers in Russia and Indonesia. "It\'s very challenging, nickel prices are famously volatile," he said. "Back in 2007 it got up to $50,000 per tonne. It\'s around $16,000 a tonne now. It\'s been as low as $5,000 a tonne.',
                   'Australia\’s first alleged Christian terrorists forged their fateful bond decades ago when they jointly accused two of their parents of child sexual abuse and cut all family ties. Nathaniel, Gareth and Stacey Train died in a shootout with Queensland police after killing three people, including two officers, on a remote property at Wieambilla on the Darling Downs in December 2022. Police have concluded the trio "executed a religiously motivated terrorist attack", believing the world was ending and police were "monsters and demons". How the trio reached this point will be examined in an upcoming coronial inquest into the shooting. A clue has been offered by Nathaniel and Gareth\’s father in an interview with ABC\’s Background Briefing. Ron Train has revealed for the first time to Background Briefing that his sons cut contact in 1999 after alleging they were abused as children. Estranged from the family, the trio then moved around regional Australia, frequently sharing a home. In the last year of their lives, they were isolated and paranoid, culminating in the police shooting. Ron Train said he and his late wife, Gwen, were horrified by the allegations against them. "That was the devastating thing to me, to think these boys who I had raised and loved … made certain allegations which were totally false and unproven," he said. Ron and Gwen\’s other children stuck by their parents following the estrangement. The Train brothers met Stacey Christoffel as teenagers through a Baptist church in Toowoomba, where their father, Ron, was a minister. Ron Train said Stacey took the lead in ventilating the abuse claims during a family wedding in Coffs Harbour in 1999. In the first of this two-part investigation into Australia\’s first Christian terrorists, reporter Josh Robertson examines how a trio from Queensland forged a bond that would turn deadly. She and Nathaniel, who were then married with two young children, turned up unexpectedly with Nathaniel\’s brother, Gareth, after avoiding the family for months. "Stacey blew her top and made certain accusations against Gwen, which bewildered Gwen," Ron Train said. "She flew off the handle. She was very aggressive. "I heard all the commotion, and my brother got up and went out to find out what it was. And he asked Stacey to leave the house because of her behaviour." Nathaniel and Gareth told Ron\’s brother they\’d been "sexually abused" at home in Richmond, north-west of Sydney, where the family lived until the boys were aged six and seven respectively. "My brother said to them, \’Don\’t be ridiculous. You know your mother and father loved you very much … and wouldn\’t even contemplate such things,\’" Ron recalls. Ron said Nathaniel tried to begin a "rational discussion" with him but "Stacey flew in and … pulled him away". He said he later wrote to his sons, challenging their claims and suggesting they be put to the family doctor, but the brothers never responded. Ron said he asked about the abuse allegations when meeting a Queensland Police detective investigating the 2022 shootings. "[The detective] said: \’We\’ve investigated all that stuff. There\’s nothing in that at all.\’" Queensland Police told Background Briefing it was not appropriate to comment on matters relevant to a coronial inquest, with hearings beginning July 29. A relative told Background Briefing the broader family did not consider the abuse allegations credible. This relative said Nathaniel accused his mother of harming her children by walking around the house in her underwear. Ron Train said he believed Stacey had a "major influence" on the Train family upheaval. She had been "deeply troubled" by her own family\’s handling of a suspected sexual predator within its ranks, he said. She was distressed to learn her parents had invited a relative accused of sexual abuse to her 1995 wedding without informing her of the allegations. Ron says Stacey wanted her parents to be publicly castigated in the Church where he was a minister. "And I said, \’No, I\’m not going to put your parents in an embarrassing situation\’. "Well, that didn\’t go down well with Nathaniel and Stacey." He said the couple also pressured him to reveal what he had known about the alleged abuse. "I knew some of the circumstances, but because it had been shared to me in confidence as a pastor, I couldn\’t share any information, and that disturbed [Stacey and Nathaniel]," he said. Stacey\’s father, Philip Christoffel, declined to comment. Mr Train said the trio\’s decision to "sever ties with both our family and Stacey\’s family was devastating". "I thought, that\’s a big thing to do, to walk away from two families and try to develop themselves, the three of them — Stacey, Gareth, Nathaniel." Ron would not see his two grandchildren again for decades. Following the estrangement, Nathaniel left his job at a high school with an elite sports program near the Gold Coast, and moved with Stacey and Gareth to north Queensland. Nathaniel and Stacey began carving out careers as teachers in Indigenous education. It eventually filtered back to the families that Stacey had left Nathaniel for Gareth. This was deeply at odds with their conservative Christian upbringing. Stacey and Gareth then primarily raised Nathaniel\’s children, who later went to boarding school. "[Gareth] wanted to be head of his own family. That was his dream," Ron said. "He achieved it, but at the expense of Nathaniel and Stacey\’s marriage, in my view. "I see it as an absolute betrayal." Despite Gareth replacing Nathaniel as Stacey\’s husband, the trio lived together on and off and bought a house on the Atherton Tablelands in 2004. Ron said when Stacey\’s parents tried to reconcile with her that year: "Gareth came to the door with a baseball bat and said, \’Get out of here.\’" Ron said he took his own shot at reconciliation the following year, with his wife, Gwen. "Gareth and Stacy were inside somewhere," he recalls. "Nathaniel answered the door. I said, \’Can you speak to Mum and I, mate,\’ and he said, \’No, Dad. Off the property, please.\’" Ron said that even before the estrangement, Nathaniel and Gareth were the closest of his four children despite their starkly different personalities. Nathaniel, a junior tennis champion who achieved at school, was a "calming influence" and "on track to help people". Gareth was "more aggressive, controlling" and had learning difficulties. He was expelled from an agricultural college in Dalby after throwing another student through a pane of glass. Nathaniel and Gareth applied to join the Australian Defence Force, but abandoned the plan when Gareth "failed the psych test", according to Ron. The estrangement brought the brothers even closer, forging a bond that survived Gareth taking Nathaniel\’s wife. Stacey and Gareth Train in a video posted to YouTube on the night of the police shooting at Wieambilla, in rural Queensland. Ron believes Nathaniel initially stayed close to his brother and ex-wife "to have contact with his children". But he suspects the connection ran deeper than that. He could not picture Nathaniel buying into unhinged conspiracy theories like Gareth and Stacey, who were "two people extreme in their ideas". But ultimately, Nathaniel was "certainly under the influence of Gareth and Stacey to support them through whatever reckoning was going to take place". "There was certainly a loyalty bond between Gareth and Nathaniel, which is — I don\’t know whether it\’s [implicitly] disturbing, but in the end, it worked out that way," Ron said.',
                   'Nursing a wonky knee and needing two cortisone injections for her neck, Melissa Wu went further north in her body to make Australian diving history. The 32-year-old focused heavily on her mind and it has paid off, with Wu about to be the first Australian to dive at five Olympics. Last month, Wu secured Olympic selection by winning the 10m platform at the national championships. Just four weeks out from the nationals, Wu\’s injuries meant the two-time Olympic medallist had been unable to practise her competition dives. "As time goes on, it gets harder and harder — not just because I\’ve had a lot of injuries, but it\’s putting your body through a gruelling sport like diving," she said. "The older I get, the more I appreciate it, definitely. This has been a lot harder, this prep … not just physically, but having that trust in myself. "I had to work very hard in my mindset. I started doing visualisation, something I\’d always struggled to do. "I knew I was going to have to dig deep and find something, do something different to make this team." Given Wu\’s injury problems, some aspects of her training program have been reduced heavily and others, such as nutrition and psychology, have received a much sharper focus. "I knew to get through the trials, I was going to have to rely on a lot of the mindset work I was doing, trying to focus on doing as much of that as I could," she said. "I had to make a really strict plan as to how I was going to get there, when I was going to take up which dives. "I was nervous, but I knew that I really wanted to be on this team — it means a lot to me." Wu looks wistfully at what younger divers are doing in their training, but also knows what works now for her. After repeatedly hitting the water at 60km/h from 10m up, her body needs a different preparation. "I can\’t train like the young guns any more. Now it\’s about being smart … making sure that everything I\’m doing in training is in preparation to be on that 10m platform in Paris," she said. "I\’ve had to learn that more is not always more and the way we\’ve always done things is not necessarily the right way for me, right now. "I see the younger athletes training and I want to do exactly what they\’re doing, and do it better. "But now it\’s knowing I need to trust myself, trust that what I\’m doing is enough." The women\’s 10m platform starts on Tuesday, August 6, at 11pm (AEST). ABC Sport will be live blogging all the action overnight through the Paris Olympics.',
                   'THE IRONMAN 70.3 Western Australia Asia-Pacific Championship has reached capacity, with limited entries remaining for IRONMAN Western Australia, set to be held on the same day, December 1 2024. Geoff Meyer, Managing Director of Oceania for The IRONMAN Group, said IRONMAN 70.3 WA continued to be popular with athletes from all over the world. "We\’re thrilled with the response from athletes... which means we have put up the sold-out sign for this year\’s event, with the only way that athletes can now be involved being through the IRONMAN race," he said. "Athletes from across Australia and around the world are set to make their way to Busselton for this event that is on the bucket list of so many triathletes. "It\’s easy to see why this event is popular, from the incredible swim that goes alongside and under the historic Jetty, to the flat and fast bike course and the run that is lined with cheering spectators." Busselton Mayor Phill Cronin said the sellout was a salute to organisers and the region. "Don\’t despair if you missed out, there\’s still opportunity for triathletes to participate in Busselton for 2024 by signing up for the IRONMAN race, this year celebrating its 20th anniversary in beautiful Busselton," he said.',
                   'The Geographe Community Landcare Nursery (GCLN) is celebrating a much-needed boost in funding thanks to a 2024 NAB Foundation Community Grant. The $10,496.00 grant will be used to purchase 12 workbenches and two trollies, as part of the Nursery\’s Drought Recovery Initiative. But there\’s more to be done to help the group achieve its goal of increasing production of local native plants. "Our region has just experienced the hottest and driest Summer and Autumn on record, and we are anticipating a higher demand for drought tolerant species to replace some of the plants lost in the drought," GCLN\’s Anne Grove explained. She said the South West was showing severe signs of heat, and drought stress, and all evidence pointed to an increased frequency and severity of long, dry periods. "When the dry effects the flora, it has a roll-on effect on our native wildlife, restricting or decimating both habitat and food sources. Volunteers at the Geographe Community Landcare Nursery were presented with a cheque for more than $10,000 thanks to the NAB Foundation Community Grant program. Picture supplied. "With this in mind, the purpose of our organisation is heightened and the production of native species with local provenance has never been more important. "Based on the evidence, we anticipate the demand for our native plants will increase substantially over the next 3 years and continue to grow exponentially thereon." The Nursery was one of 25 organisations across Australia to share in $600,000 from the latest round of the NAB Foundation program. Anne said the generous grant would help the Nursery purchase benches to increase production, but it was in desperate need of additional hands on deck. "The Nursery\’s ability to meet this increasing demand in the short term is currently restricted by a shortage of volunteers to help us propagate more plants and this is now becoming quite urgent," she said. "Having sufficient volunteers to undertake this propagation task is a key component of our success." If you would like to help with growing plants for revegetation of bushland, farming areas, home gardens and public parks, please contact Anne admin@gcln.org.au or 0438 930 898.',
                   'This popular Japanese item is popping up in more 7-Eleven stores than ever before — and Aussies are hoping it\’s a sign of more things to come. A social media user took to Reddit to express their excitement at finding teriyaki chicken onigiri at a 7-Eleven store. “Japanese food starting to pop up at 7/11 since the Japanese 7/11 buyout,” they captioned the image. Others were over the moon at the discovery. “This is the best news I\’ve heard in a while. Japanese 7/11 is incredible,” one commented. Onigiri is now available in more 7-Eleven stores. Another said, “These are delicious.” However, it turns out it has nothing to do with new 7-Eleven Australia being purchased by 7-Eleven International. Onigiri has been a staple of 7-Eleven stores in Victoria for years, and the popular item has now made its way up the east coast. “Our 7-Eleven Onigiri, like our other sushi, is delivered fresh daily,” a 7-Eleven spokesperson told news.com.au. “The onigiri are $3.70 and are available in three flavours Cooked Spicy Tuna, Chicken Teriyaki or Sweet Chilli Salmon. They have been available in Victoria for quite a few years, and launched in New South Wales and Queensland (other than Cairns and Townsville) over the last few months.” 7-Eleven International LLC announced in April that it had successfully acquired 7-Eleven Australia, adding 750 stores to its network. Aussies are hoping it means more Japanese products. Many speculated the takeover would transform the convenience store\’s food offerings, with social media users hoping it would take notes from the Japanese version of the chain. “Bring on the little pancakes in a packet,” one social media user pleaded. Another added, “I\’m so happy, I hope Japan purges the Australian market of bland food.” The 7-Eleven spokesperson said the Australian chain had a “long-term focus on our food offerings”. “Now as part of the 7-Eleven International network we are looking forward to working more closely with our international counterparts to grow our food offer,” they said. “Without question, 7-Eleven Japan has one of the best food offers in convenience in the world, so their expertise is going to be invaluable in helping to set a new benchmark for food here in Australia.”',
                   'A travel influencer has ripped a world-renowned restaurant for serving her “the worst meal” of her life — after dropping nearly $1,000 (AUD $1500) on a repast said to be so revolting, a neighbouring diner refused to pay. Chloe Jade Meltzer dropped the zero-star review in a series of videos for the restaurant in Spain\’s Basque Country — snagging eight million views on TikTok. “I truly cannot believe how bad this restaurant was,” Meltzer moaned in one of the posts, the New York Post reported. The object of the globetrotter\’s ire was Mugaritz, a two Michelin-starred establishment in San Sebastian, Spain, that regularly appears on lists of the world\’s best eateries. Andoni Luis Aduriz, the chef at Mugaritz, is renowned for his culinary creativity — which seems to have been altogether unappreciated by at least one table during the recent visit. “For approximately three hours, and through about 23-25 creations, together we will try to weave a tale of stories, gestures and emotions,” the restaurant\’s website promises potential diners. Chloe Jade Meltzner is a travel influencer. Picture: chloejadetravels/TikTok “Flavours, textures and aromas that you can enjoy and feel using your hands to stimulate all the senses and to evoke our more primal customs,” the pitch goes on. Meltzer said she was initially intrigued by the “inventive” setup, recalling how she selected her wine by picking a photo and telling the servers “three things about yourself” — like cabernet Charades. Unfortunately, the meal appeared to go downhill almost immediately with the arrival of the first dish, a vaseline-evoking blob of fish goop that patrons were required to eat with their hands. “I was essentially eating lip gloss,” lamented Meltzer, while licking the viscous gloop from her fingers like an aardvark. Other lowlights included a “sea rash” that the well-travelled eater compared to a “soggy cigar,” and a “belly button”-shaped Mold comprised of kefir and olive oil that diners are “supposed to suck weird juice out of” — like an interactive movie prosthetic.  Other alleged indignities inflicted included “charred spinach with BBQ sauce,” a fermented potato skin with more “disgusting BBQ sauce” — a combo that the influencer analogised to a “makeup wipe” — as well as some “old bucatini” and a “churro” that was actually uncooked plantain, clearly the culinary equivalent of catfishing. The total price tag for this malevolent-seeming meal? 897 Euros (AU $1496) for Meltzer\’s party. “I truly don\’t understand how this restaurant is in business,” fumed the content creator. “It is the worst restaurant I\’ve ever been to in my life.” And while Meltzer, an apparent pescetarian who admits to avoiding at least one meat dish during her measured take-down, observed that Mugaritz gives diners a disclaimer at the start warning them that they won\’t “like all of the dishes.” However, she said, it didn\’t make any sense for everything to be “utterly disgusting.” The TikTokker wasn\’t the only reviewer who felt that the restaurant was the emperor\’s new clothes. She claimed that one patron was “so tired of the BS” that he refused to pay the bill until the police were called, as seen in her second video. The TikTok commentariat was bemused by Meltzer\’s skewering with one writing “I am so obsessed with bad Michelin star restaurant reviews.” Another wrote, “This is why I don\’t go to Michelin star restaurants without extensive research and review. I don\’t mind paying the price but not for pretentious garbage.” Many compared the experience to the 2022 foodie thriller The Menu, in which unsuspecting patrons are invited to a sadistic social experiment under the guise of an avant-garde tasting menu. Mugaritz currently holds an average rating of 3.5 stars out of 5 on TripAdvisor, however the reviews from the past few months are overwhelmingly negative. One rater dubbed the experience “awful from start to finish”. “At the end of the day however clever you think you are as a chef — the food has to taste good and in reality the food is a disaster,” Meltzer declared. “From the 22 courses served there was not a single dish that I would ever want to eat again.” “Yes experiment, yes support local produce, yes be seasonal, yes, challenge the guests to a new experience — but somewhere along that journey it has to taste good,” she said.',
                   'President Joe Biden\’s top campaign staffer insists that he will stay in the race, even as calls grow among his fellow Democrats in Congress for him to end his floundering re-election bid and make way for a new candidate. More than one in eight congressional Democrats have now publicly called on the 81-year-old incumbent - who is isolating at his Delaware home with a case of COVID - to drop out following a disastrous June debate against Republican Donald Trump that raised questions about Biden\’s ability to win or to carry out his duties for another four years. The divide among Democrats stood in sharp contrast to the scenes that played out his week at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where former party rivals united around Trump, who accepted the Republican nomination in a rambling speech that featured his familiar mix of grievance and bombast. So far, 34 of the 264 congressional Democrats have publicly called for Biden to end his campaign, while other senior Democratic leaders have pushed him behind the scenes to do so, according to sources and media reports. They represent more than one in eight Democrats in Congress, where Biden\’s party controls 213 seats in the House of Representatives and 51 in the Senate. “We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardising what should be a winning campaign,” Representatives Jared Huffman, Marc Veasey, Chuy Garcia and Marc Pocan wrote in a letter on Friday. Democratic US Senator Martin Heinrich said on social media: “While the decision to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden\’s alone, I believe it is in the best interests of our country for him to step aside.” Democrats are increasingly worried about a Republican sweep in the November 5 election that could leave Trump and his allies not only in charge of the White House but also with majorities in both chambers of Congress.Pass the Torch, a group that wants Biden to step down, has launched a TV ad to air in Washington and Delaware. Biden had no public events scheduled for Friday, but a top adviser said he would return to the campaign trail next week. “He is absolutely in it,” Biden campaign chairwoman Jen O\’Malley Dillon told MSNBC in an interview. Former House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi is among those who have told Biden he cannot win in November, according to a White House source familiar with the matter. After weeks of insisting he will remain in the race, Biden is now taking calls to step aside seriously, and multiple Democratic officials think an exit is a matter of time, sources said. Though a Reuters/Ipsos poll earlier this week found Biden and Trump effectively tied, strategists from both parties say Biden\’s path to victory is narrowing as he trails in most of the battleground states that will decide the election. Were Biden to step aside as a candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, 59, could fill the role. Reuters/Ipsos polling shows her as performing marginally better against Trump in a theoretical head-to-head matchup. With his grip on the Republican Party never tighter, Trump is in a much stronger position than in his 2017-2021 term to follow through on his agenda if he wins the election. At the convention in Milwaukee, Trump delivered a dramatic account of the attempt on his life by a gunman at a Pennsylvania rally last Saturday and sought to appeal to undecided voters with a promise to be a president for “all of America, not half of America.” “In an age when our politics too often divide us, now is the time to remember that we are all fellow citizens,” Trump said. But he quickly abandoned the message of unity he had promised in the wake of the shooting, pivoting to well-worn attacks on the Biden administration. He claimed without evidence that his criminal indictments were part of a Democratic conspiracy, predicted Biden would usher in “World War III” and described what he called an “invasion” of migrants over the southern border. Trump devoted much of his 92-minute speech to attacking migrants, a theme that has always animated his campaigns.',
                   'At just 19 years old, Noah* had already lived a “tough life”. That was the assessment of NAB Bank customer advisor Rae Mulgrew, who was in the Colac branch, 150km southwest of Melbourne, when Noah walked in looking to buy a home. He hadn\’t had a place to call his own for years, but had diligently saved up thousands of dollars as he slept on couches. It was a sum of money he soon discovered still wasn\’t enough for a house deposit. That was before he was accepted into a government-run home buying scheme, under which another 35,000 places have opened up from July 1. A further 10,000 have been reserved for regional Australians like Noah, and another 5000 places reserved for single parents. Noah had $20,000 to his name when Mulgrew met him. “(But) even after saving every cent he made, he was still short of the 20 per cent deposit he thought he needed to secure a home loan,” she said. His journey towards homeownership wasn\’t thwarted so easily. Mulgrew and the manager of the Colac branch, Louise Morrissy, worked for months to help Noah secure a spot in the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee scheme. And the regional banking staff would later go beyond their professional responsibility to care for the young homebuyer — with a heartwarming gesture of support. “We have a strong connection to our community, and we really care for all the customers that walk through our door in Colac,” Morrisy said. The Home Guarantee Scheme is a government initiative that helps first home buyers, or buyers who have not owned a property over the past 10 years, to buy a home. It allows them to enter the market with a deposit of as little as 5 per cent, and without lenders mortgage insurance. Noah would become one of 1,600 regional, first-home buyers who NAB helped under the scheme last financial year. “Noah was determined to reach his goal of having his own place,” Mulgrew said. “He had no idea about the scheme when he first walked in. “Without it, he wouldn\’t have been able to get his foot on the property ladder.” Morrissy added: “We were by Noah\’s side every step of the way, walking him through the services he needed to engage in buying the property.” In true regional community-style, the Colac NAB team collected a care package full of items to congratulate Noah when he eventually received the keys to his first home. “We made up a little hamper of cups, saucers, sheets, you name it, just to get him started,” Morrissy said. “He kept telling me he couldn\’t give me anything in return, but I didn\’t want anything. “I just wanted to know he was settled and safe in his new home.” Mulgrew said: “The team in the branch felt we had to do something to make sure his house felt like a home.” For young, regional-based Australians looking for safe and secure housing, she said the scheme was empowering. “It makes the Australian dream achievable,” she said.

                   'Two Australians are among five people to have miraculously walked away unharmed after their helicopter crashed into a village in Bali. Russell Harris embarked on the scenic flight with his Indonesian partner Keylla and his friend from Perth, Chris, about 2.30pm yesterday to celebrate his 46th birthday. About four minutes after the trio took off with two crew members from South Kuta, they noticed a kite in their path. With the kite string tangled around the main rotor, the helicopter lost control and quickly dropped about 40 metres down a cliff near Suluban Beach.  "Tree first, we hit them, I remember that, then we hit a cliff, flipped us upside down and came to a stop," Harris recalled. Miraculously, all five people on board survived, most with just minor injuries.',
                   'Travellers at Sydney Airport are being urged to expect further delays as strong winds continue to batter the city this morning.

                   'There\’s a new global internet speed record — and it\’s about six million times faster than Australia\’s average. A team at Japan\’s National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) hit 402 terabits per second (tbps), breaking their previous record of 321 tbps, set in 2023. Australia\’s average internet speed pales in comparison, at about 66 megabits per second (mbps), according to Speedtest.net How fast is the world\’s fastest internet? One terabit is one trillion bits; so the speed the NICT team clocked would equate to 402,000,000 mbps. At that speed, 12,500 movies could be downloaded in about a second. "If the average world download speed is, let\’s say 100 mbps, then our data rate is indeed 4 million times faster than that," Ben Puttnam, NICT chief senior researcher, said. He said it\’s unlikely a 402 tbps connection would be used in a household. Instead, it would likely sit "in the core of a network" "So you could think of it as a big data pipe that could connect four million homes each using 100 mbps, for example," he said. If a 3 mbps connection is needed to stream a movie on Netflix, Puttnam said a 402 tbps connection could support 130 million simultaneous streams. Gamers could also expect a hitch-free virtual reality experience playing games like Baldur\’s Gate 3 or Call of Duty. How do Australian internet speeds compare internationally? According to Speedtest.net, the global average download speed for fixed broadband internet is 93.93 mbps. By that measure, this new record speed is a few million times faster than what most of us get in our homes in Australia. At 66.58 mbps, Australia is ranked 82 on SpeedTest\’s June index of fixed broadband speeds worldwide, behind Oman and Czechia and just above Uzbekistan. Australia performed better on mobile internet speeds — ranking 22 with 94.28 mbps, behind Croatia and Estonia. The global mobile internet speed average is 56.43 mbps. Could Australian\’s ever have access to 402 tbps speds? Not anytime soon. While the recent world record was set using standard commercially available optical fibre, the speed test occurred in ideal lab conditions. Commercial deployment of technology that would enable such speeds won\’t be coming to an internet provider near you anytime soon. In addition to researchers from NICT, the record-setting team included academics from Aston University\’s Institute of Photonic Research in the UK and researchers from Nokia Bell Labs in the United States.',
                   'The United Nations\’ highest court said on Friday that Israel\’s occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements there are illegal and should be withdrawn as soon as possible, in its strongest findings to date on the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The advisory opinion by judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), known as the World Court, was not binding but carries weight under international law and may weaken support for Israel. Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and the regime associated with them, have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law," ICJ resident Nawaf Salam said, reading the findings of a 15-judge panel. The court said Israel\’s obligations include paying restitution for harm and "the evacuation of all settlers from existing settlements". In a swift reaction, Israel\’s foreign ministry rejected the opinion as "fundamentally wrong" and one-sided, and repeated its stance that a political settlement in the region can only be reached by negotiations. "The Jewish nation cannot be an occupier in its own land," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\’s office said in a statement. The opinion also angered West Bank settlers as well as politicians such as finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, whose nationalist religious party is close to the settler movement and who himself lives in a West Bank settlement. "The answer to The Hague - Sovereignty now" he said in a post on the social media platform X, in an apparent appeal to formally annex the West Bank. Israel Gantz, head of the Binyamin Regional Council, one of the largest settler councils, said the ICJ opinion was "contrary to the Bible, morality and international law". The ICJ opinion also found that the UN Security Council, the General Assembly and all states have an obligation not to recognise the occupation as legal nor "render aid or assistance" toward maintaining Israel\’s presence in the occupied territories. The Palestinian foreign ministry called the opinion "historic" and urged states to adhere to it. "No aid. No assistance. No complicity. No money, no arms, no trade...no actions of any kind to support Israel\’s illegal occupation," Palestinian envoy Riyad al-Maliki said outside the court in The Hague. The case stems from a 2022 request from the UN General Assembly, predating the Hamas-Israel war that began in October. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and has since built settlements in the West Bank and steadily expanded them. Israeli leaders argue the territories are not occupied in legal terms because they are on disputed lands, but the United Nations and most of the international community regard them as occupied territory. In February, more than 50 states presented their views before the court, with Palestinian representatives asking the court to find that Israel must withdraw from all the occupied areas and dismantle illegal settlements. Israel did not participate in the oral hearings but filed a written statement telling the court that issuing an advisory opinion would be "harmful" to attempts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The majority of states participating asked the court to find the occupation illegal, while a handful, including Canada and the United Kingdom, argued it should refuse to give an advisory opinion. The United States, which is Israel\’s biggest military ally and supporter, had asked the court not to order the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian territories. The US position was that the court should issue no decision that could hurt negotiations toward a two-state solution on a "land for peace" principle. In 2004 the ICJ gave an advisory ruling that an Israeli separation barrier around most of the West Bank was illegal and Israeli settlements were established in breach of international law. Israel dismissed that ruling.',
                   'When Cheryll and her partner were deciding whether to continue trying for a baby, they started to think about how their day-to-day life with a child would actually look.

Both of them were diagnosed with conditions that made it more difficult for them to conceive, and Cheryll also had to spend around $10,000 for other health expenses including surgery to diagnose her endometriosis, which she did through the private system. The process was emotionally tough, Cheryll said. On top of that, the out-of-pocket cost of the treatments made them reassess whether it was financially viable for them to have kids. It just seemed like it was just going to be too stressful, like we weren\’t going to have a very good relationship with each other, or our kid. The couple lives paycheck-to-paycheck and Cheryll said she probably couldn\’t afford to take much maternity leave so her baby would have to be in child care from an early age. "Someone else would basically be raising our kid and there would be no room to actually enjoy being a parent," she said. Eventually, they decided to stop trying. While the decision was mainly due to the emotional toll, financial concerns "sealed the deal", she said. "You\’re not getting the results that you want but then you kind of go \’Is everything worth it?\’." Life feels too difficult for many young people considering parenthood. For young people weighing up the costs of having a baby, Australia can look "inhospitable to families", demographer Dr Liz Allen of the Australian National University (ANU) told SBS News. She said housing affordability, the rising cost of living, lack of secure employment, and concerns over the impacts of climate change, were all impacting young people\’s decisions on whether to have children and how many kids they could afford. "We know that young people are foregoing having children because they can\’t afford it," Allen said. The number of live births per woman in Australia is around 1.7, lower than the 2.1 babies required to maintain a constant population size over the long term without migration. She said many young people were only wanting one or two children because life felt too difficult or uncertain. "That uncertainty is going to undermine our security and potentially our democracy into the future," she said. "We\’ve created a system that is inhospitable to families and the future of this country, that must be changed." We\’ve created a system that is inhospitable to families and the future of this country, that must be changed. Former NSW resident Amy, who is in her early 30s and now living in the United Kingdom, says she is frustrated that older generations believe the "traditional timeline" is still achievable. "My generation have taken 10-plus years longer to break into the housing market, and five-plus years longer to find a life partner," she told SBS News. She said she had worked hard in her 20s and so had her partner. "Neither of us feel we\’ve had the time to be financially stable adults who can enjoy our adulthood before having kids." My generation have taken 10-plus years longer to break into the housing market, and five-plus years longer to find a life partner. Amy, former NSW resident She said the couple wanted a comfortable home, financial stability and enough money to go on a couple of holidays a year. "Inflation and the cost of living make these small dreams impossible for so many," she said. "I\’d want my child to have the childhood I was given but we can\’t afford that." She said her parents had married at 21 years old, bought a house and had three children. "I married a year ago at age 30 and we\’re still renting." People need to feel confident about their jobs KPMG urban economist Terry Rawnsley said fertility rates were often linked to economic cycles. "People want to have confidence that both they, [and] their partner, have jobs and those jobs will be around for a while." He agreed that housing affordability was also likely "crimping" the fertility rate. "If you live in a two-bedroom unit in Sydney, and that\’s what you can afford, having one child makes logistical sense," he said. "But having two children — it\’s much harder to do that in a two-bedroom apartment [and] you might not be able to afford a three-bedroom townhouse." Rawnsley said cities that were more expensive to live in, such as Sydney, had lower birth rates, compared to more affordable cities like Brisbane. He said improving fertility rates in Australia could ease the reliance on migrants in the long term, although it would not do anything to address current labour shortages. Australia is one of around 50 countries and areas, where immigration is projected to be the main driver of population growth through to 2100. Other countries include Canada and the United States. Relying on immigration to boost the proportion of working-age people in the country was not necessarily a problem, but it did make issues around housing affordability more likely, Rawnsley said. He also said there were also potential risks around relying on migration. "The whole world is ageing — and there\’s just more and more competition for skilled migrants across the world," he said. Allen said policies in Australia needed to better reflect the current reality young people were living, rather than the 1950s model of a family with a male breadwinner. "We need to be able to support families no matter what they look like, to survive and to thrive," she said. "That cannot mean that the only way to survive and the only way to make ends meet is to have a dual income [of] $150,000 each to break into the property market." Allen said Australia should stop relying on the market to fix things like housing affordability. "We\’ve relied on business entities and the private market to control these things; government need to take more steps to consider what can be done." This could include removing tax incentives for property speculation to make it easier for people to buy a home, rather than renting. She said rental rights also needed to be improved as home ownership was getting more difficult. Promoting gender equality was also important, Allen said, as women were still doing the largest share of unpaid work and were also being asked to participate in the paid workforce. "We\’re asking women to do it all," she said. "But actually, we\’re saying [that] in order to have it all, you literally have to do it all, and we\’re not seeing men step up." If women "want it all", they are expected to do it all, experts say. She said workplaces and society in general should be more supportive of gender equality so that both men and women could have a family if they wanted without compromising on their own identity. This includes supporting men to be the primary caregiver if they want, she said.  "[Then] we can ensure a healthy population, a healthy workforce and healthy ageing, to ensure that we have a future worth living." Reality of having children does not appeal Amy said she didn\’t see many examples of mothers her age who seemed truly happy. "They lose themselves to it and are quite depressed as a result," she said. "They also hold a lot of resentment for their partners and I\’d rather a marriage where we\’re equal, happy and fulfilled as we are." Cheryll and her partner had only just finished paying off the debt from their medical bills, and have decided to embrace not having a child. She is now co-hosting a podcast about being childless called Barrenesses. "I feel good about that decision," she said about quitting fertility treatments. "But I don\’t really feel good about how the government keeps telling us to have kids but they don\’t really want to look at the reality of how hard it is for people."',
                   'A global technology outage on Friday grounded flights, disrupted health services, crashed payment systems and blocked access to Microsoft services in what experts believe is one of the largest IT failures in history. The cause of the disruptions originated from a cybersecurity firm called CrowdStrike, which provides software to a wide range of industries. An update to one of CrowdStrike\’s pieces of software, Falcon Sensor, malfunctioned, throwing a wrench into computers running Windows, leading to major tech failures around the world, the company said. Here\’s what we know about the outage so far. What is CrowdStrike? CrowdStrike is an American cybersecurity firm founded in 2011 and based in Austin, Texas. Since its inception, the company has grown rapidly as it began to offer a range of security services using cloud-based software. It has raised millions in funding from Silicon Valley powerhouses such as Google\’s venture capital arm. It employs thousands of workers and services businesses in countries across the globe, boasting on its website that it protects 538 out of the Fortune 1000 companies. The firm has become immensely successful over the past decade, with a market value of around $83bn at market close on Thursday, though its stock price was falling during Friday trading. CrowdStrike\’s share value declined dramatically following the outage, dipping as much as 13% early on Friday. While the company\’s primary products are intended to block hackers and malware, CrowdStrike has also been hired to investigate major data breaches. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 tasked CrowdStrike with investigating the Russian hack of DNC servers, while Sony Pictures employed the company to look into a 2014 cyberattack linked to North Korea. CrowdStrike\’s investigation into the DNC hack also previously played a small but notable role in the first impeachment of Donald Trump and special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump, echoing a widely repudiated conspiracy theory that CrowdStrike was involved in an elaborate cover up on behalf of the DNC, nonsensically suggested the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, look into the company, a piece of the quid pro quo accusations against the US president. How did CrowdStrike cause the global outage? The global outage stems from an update CrowdStrike made to its marquee cybersecurity platform, a cloud-based software product called Falcon. When CrowdStrike pushed an update to the Falcon software, which interacts with other parts of computer systems and software like Microsoft\’s Windows products, it caused a malfunction that essentially disabled those systems and their widely used pieces of software the world over. Put bluntly, the software intended to protect against crashes and disruptions in vital computer systems ended up taking them down. CrowdStrike\’s CEO, George Kurtz, has apologized for the outage, which the company has stated was due to a faulty piece of code. “This is not a security incident or cyberattack. The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed,” Kurtz wrote on Twitter. “We refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website.” Compounding the chaos on Friday, another outage also hit Microsoft\’s Azure cloud services and caused an additional set of failures. Microsoft has stated that the two outages were unrelated, and that its Azure services were now back online. Kurtz meanwhile told NBC\’s Today show that it could be “some time” before systems fully recover from the outage his company caused.',
                   'After conducting more than 200 interviews and combing through his phone and internet search history, federal investigators have pieced together an early portrait of the man who sought to assassinate former President Donald Trump: Thomas Matthew Crooks was an intelligent, unassuming loner, who expressed an interest in guns and was far from outspoken about politics. But the emerging profile of Crooks nearly a week after the shooting has left authorities puzzled about a motive for his assault and has had investigators speculating that his intentions may have been less politically motivated and more about attacking the highest-profile target near him. The investigation remains in its early stages, officials caution. Still, in some ways, Crooks seems similar to the dozens of other young men who\’ve wreaked havoc across the US with high-powered assault-style rifles in recent years. He had few close friends, he would often go shooting at a local firing range, and he didn\’t seem to display strongly held views that would suggest a politically driven assassination, according to CNN interviews with law enforcement and a review of notes from a briefing to Congress. In addition to the former president, Crooks had searched online about President Joe Biden and had photos on his phone of other prominent figures from both parties. He searched for the location of Trump\’s rally as well as the upcoming Democratic National Convention, the briefing notes say, and discovered that Trump planned to appear just an hour\’s drive away from his home in the Pittsburgh suburbs. That suggests Crooks may have been looking to carry out a high-profile shooting, and the Trump event\’s proximity and timing offered the most accessible opportunity, federal officials have speculated. “Even though he didn\’t get his primary target, the shooter was successful in a lot of ways because he got closer to doing something no one has done in decades,” one federal official told CNN, referring to the assassination of a presidential candidate. It remains unclear if Crooks intended to carry out a much larger attack and started with Trump because that was the way to gain the most notoriety. Crooks had also searched for information on another recent mass shooter who shot and killed four classmates at a Michigan high school in 2021. The web searches about that shooter, Ethan Crumbley, are consistent with what law enforcement officials have seen in other mass shooters who research people they wish to emulate, in part, as a way to form their own idea of how to do something bigger, the federal official said. But there are also significant differences between Crooks\’ behavior and that of a typical mass shooter. On the day of the attack, Crooks appeared to have been specifically targeting Trump – not aiming at the crowds in an attempt to kill as many people as possible. While he had an improvised explosive in the trunk of his car, it\’s not clear if he planned to set it off to kill people or as a distraction. Kathleen Puckett, a former FBI behavioral analyst who worked on the case of the “Unabomber” Ted Kaczynski, said that Crooks also appeared to have less firepower than many mass shooters, who often carry multiple weapons and wear body armor. “It didn\’t look to me like he was ready for an assault,” Puckett said, while noting the limits of publicly available information. “It looked to me like he was taking a window that he saw a vulnerability in where he felt that he was unobserved to the extent he could get off some critical shots.” In addition, unlike other mass shooters who often leave behind writings to explain their attacks, authorities have thus far recovered few clues, in Crooks\’ bedroom or online. That is frustrating experts who are trying to piece together his mindset – and raising comparisons with Stephen Paddock, the gunman who killed 60 people in Las Vegas in 2017. Nearly seven years after America\’s deadliest mass shooting, investigators still do not know why Paddock pulled the trigger. Like the Las Vegas massacre, “this may be a situation where the more we know, the less we understand about the exact reason why,” said Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security and a CNN national security analyst. Crooks\’ family members told investigators he did not openly discuss politics, and evidence recovered at his home shed no further light on his political values or ideology, according to a readout shared with CNN that details a briefing that FBI and US Secret Service officials gave lawmakers Wednesday. Mary Ellen O\’Toole, a former FBI profiler, said that based on the evidence assembled so far, she thought that Trump\’s rally was “very appealing” to Crooks in part because it “fell in his backyard.” “This gave him incredible attention and catapulted him to a point where I think that\’s why he chose this,” she speculated. Still, Puckett called lone offenders – who largely remain invisible before attacks – “one of the prickliest problems out there” for law enforcement, and warned against a rush to find simple answers about Crooks\’ motive. “Whatever his story turns out to be, it\’s not going to be simplistic, I don\’t think – it\’s going to be more complicated,” Puckett said. “You don\’t want the simplistic version. You want every detail you can find.”',
                   'Years ago, some people would spend hours at Starbucks. Today, it\’s a takeout counter. At many Starbucks locations, you\’re lucky to find anyone sitting down. Under Howard Schultz, Starbucks\’ longtime leader, cafes were positioned as a “third place” between work and home, where people could linger for hours on plush purple armchairs, socialize and connect. “If you look at the landscape of retail and restaurants in America, there is such a fracturing of places where people meet,” Schultz said in a 1995 profile of Starbucks for an industry publication. “There\’s nowhere for people to go. So we created a place where people can feel comfortable.” The idea of Starbucks as a third place became part of its corporate mythology. Starbucks aimed to create a welcoming environment for coffee drinkers and employees with comfortable seating, jazz music and the aroma of freshly-brewed coffee. Employees who brewed and served Starbucks coffee, whom Starbucks called baristas, handwrote customers\’ names on their drink orders. By the time Michelle Eisen joined Starbucks in 2010 as an employee in Buffalo, New York, her store was always packed during the holidays with people meeting friends and family. She witnessed first dates and helped a customer\’s propose to his spouse, writing “will you marry me?” on a cup. “It was a cheerful, amazing thing to be part of it,” she said of working at Starbucks and forming close relationships with customers. “It\’s why so many employees stayed for so long.” Eisen has helped lead Starbucks Workers United, a group unionizing company stores. But Starbucks\’ business has transformed, and it has struggled to maintain its identity as that third place along the way. Mobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks\’ sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States. In some stores, customers complained online that Starbucks pulled out comfortable chairs and replaced them with hard wooden stools. Starbucks has also built pickup-only stores without seating. Machines that print customers\’ names have replaced baristas\’ handwriting on cups. “Third place is a broader definition,” current Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said last year. The “classic definition of third place — it\’s a box where I go to meet someone — it\’s frankly not relevant anymore in this context.” Starbucks\’ sales in its home North America market dropped 3% last quarter. Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks\’ CEO (for a third time) and retired from Starbucks\’ board of directors last year, wrote a lengthy message on LinkedIn in May about the company\’s issues. “U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company\’s fall from grace. The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience,” he said. The company needs to “focus on being experiential, not transactional.” Starbucks\’ changes to its sit-down business model came in response to several trends — demand from customers for ordering coffee from their cars in drive-thru lanes or on their smartphones. The shift from a business serving hot coffee to one in which cold coffees, teas and lemonades make up more than half of sales. The Covid-19 pandemic, which forced cafes to shut indoor seating. Starbucks shifted to meet Wall Street\’s demands, too. Starbucks found it could reduce labor costs and increase order volume by running a mostly drive-thru and take-away coffee business. Starbucks also found difficulties with being America\’s third place and did not want to become the public space and bathroom for everyone, including people coming into stores who were homeless or struggling with mental health challenges on city streets. Starbucks has closed some stores and restricted bathroom access over safety concerns. But by prioritizing speed — “throughput” in corporate parlance — Starbucks hurt the appeal of sitting down for coffee in stores, some critics say. “Their success has not enabled them to retain what people originally found so attractive about the brand,” said Tom Cook, a principal at restaurant consultancy King-Casey who has worked with Starbucks. “It\’s turned into a transaction business that has very little interpersonal interaction and engagement.” Many Starbucks\’ stores feel more like a fast-food restaurant than a coffee shop, Cook said. “They had this unique image and personality. That doesn\’t exist anymore.” Starbucks\’ shift from a sit-down shop to a primarily drive-thru and mobile pickup business has been gradual. The company was hesitant to build out drive-thru stores during the 1990s, fearing they would take away from the third place appeal. “We don\’t want to become just another commodity product,” Starbucks finance chief Michael Casey said in the 1995 profile of the company. “The drive-thrus are a way for the converted to get their coffee a little quicker. It\’s not the way we want people to discover the Starbucks experience.” But Starbucks warmed to the option, finding that many customers preferred the convenience of drive-thrus on their way to work. By 2005, nearly 15% of Starbucks\’ roughly 7,300 stores were drive-thru locations. For the first time that year, more than half of new Starbucks stores were drive-thru locations. Today, 70% of Starbucks locations have a drive-thru option. Mobile ordering was another major step in Starbucks\’ road to becoming primarily a take-away business. In 2014, Starbucks debuted its mobile ordering system, which allowed customers to place pickup orders from their smartphones without having to interact with an employee. Mobile ordering also gave the company more data on consumers and helped push them to Starbucks\’ loyalty program, benefiting Starbucks because loyalty members are its most profitable customers. Mobile ordering surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when Starbucks was required to temporarily close seating areas inside to customers to prevent the virus\’ spread. Mobile orders jumped from 17% of sales in early 2020 to 26% the following year. Although mobile ordering has been popular with busy customers and investors, growing to more than 30% of sales today, it has taken away from the sit-down experience, analysts say. Starbucks baristas have complained about the crush of additional orders coming in from mobile orders and struggles to keep up with demand. People enter and exit stores more frequently, opening and closing the door and letting in the cold or heat. Mobile ordering “commoditized” Starbucks by leading it to focus on order volume and efficiency, said Joe Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons who wrote a recent article about Starbucks\’ struggles in Harvard Business Review. Starbucks\’ menu changes also had an impact on this shift. Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say. Starbucks says that it\’s evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling. In 2022, Starbucks said it was “reimagining the third place” by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks\’ mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks. Starbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations. Eisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down. The best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said. That means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders. “If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,” she said. “That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.”',
                   'The loss of rural school bus routes has left locals in one Hawke\’s Bay settlement furious at what they say is a lack of consultation from the Government, with some students now questioning whether to continue their education. Te Pōhue is around a 40 minute drive from Napier. Following a Ministry of Education review, nine rural bus runs will stop and three others will be restructured that take students to Napier and Hastings. Mum Michelle Codd told 1News the move could hurt her children\’s educational future. "You can\’t expect me to drive my son you know realistically two hours a day into town and then drive back home and then go to work ... and then do it all again in the afternoon," she said. "They\’re making me decide whether or not my 17-year-old daughter goes back for last year because we don\’t have that bus now." "If I don\’t mind using a bit of language, I\’m bloody angry," another local told 1News. Johnella Condon Orr said the decision was "just disappointing". "Our rural communities depend on them, especially if our kids can\’t go to a boarding school." The Ministry of Education said it only provides buses as a last resort and the students in Te Pōhue are either not going to their nearest school or have other transport available. According to the ministry, William Colenso College in Napier is the closest for Te Pōhue students. However, Napier\’s other schools, where students are currently enrolled, are only a few minutes further away. "Policy requires us to deliver service only to eligible students, so we apply a range of eligibility criteria," the ministry\’s James Meffan explained. "Wherever we draw a line ... some people will not win and others will. It\’s always disappointing to be on the wrong side of that line." Out of approximately 1400 ministry-contracted daily bus routes across the country, 1News can reveal that 130 have been reviewed since the beginning of Term 1 this year. The nine Hastings bus routes alone affect more than 350 students. Hastings Mayor Sandra Hazlehurst was unhappy with the lack of consultation. She said the Education Ministry should speak with communities and work out effective solutions for a school transport system, rather than making "blanket cuts for the sake of it". "I\’d like the ministry to come out to our communities and talk with us to see how we can find a solution and how we can get our children to school," she said. Meffan said because the eligibility criteria is very clear, the ministry isn\’t consulting in the sense of asking permission to carry out the changes. Codd said her only option at this stage was to put the issue back on the Education Ministry. "Tell me what you want me to do with my son." The nine affected bus routes will continue until the end of the year.',
                   'Indira Stewart reflects for the re_covering podcast on the "huge sacrifice" of training as a journalist while a solo mum-of-two on benefit. Indira Stewart is now one of Aotearoa\’s best-known and most-respected journalists, having occupied top reporting and presenting roles at the likes of TVNZ and Radio New Zealand over the last decade. But rewind to the early 2010s, and the successful career she now enjoys looks like a distant dream. Known back then as the impressive Tongan-Fijian singer who had finished runner-up in the 2006 series of New Zealand Idol, Stewart\’s life was turned upside-down as she navigated raising two children solo while surviving on a combination of singing gigs and benefit payments. In an illuminating interview with Media Chaplaincy/RNZ podcast re_covering released on Wednesday, Stewart lifted the lid on that “dark time in my life”, and the sacrifices she made to pursue journalism when the odds were stacked so heavily against her. “I walked out of a marriage at 26, divorced, with two young kids under two on my back,” she told media chaplain and re_covering host Rev Frank Ritchie. “I went through this season of really digging deep. I\’d been a people pleaser all my life, and it [this experience] made me not give a f**k about what people thought about me, which was a really raw place for me to find some courage to figure out who I was and reinvent myself.” That reinvention began with the pursuit of a different career. “I had gone down paths that were kind of formed for me – I went to uni to do music. It wasn\’t until after New Zealand Idol, doing TV for that time, that I thought, \’oh, I actually might enjoy this\’. So I went back to uni and started Communications at AUT.” Stewart reflects now that the decision was something of a return to the natural skillset she\’d demonstrated throughout her childhood. “I think I was actually always supposed to be a storyteller. From a very young age, I always had the tea on what was happening in the neighbourhood… I remember my Dad saying, \’You\’ll be a very good news reporter, you\’re good at gossiping\’. “When I was 15, Tagata Pasifika auditioned high school kids to report on the ASB Polynesian Festival, and I did the events for a couple of years and loved it. But because I\’d never seen a Tongan woman like myself on a mainstream platform, it was never even an idea that it could be a career for me.” While returning to university was the right decision, Stewart told re_covering making it work on a practical level was “very, very hard”. “I had two kids, I was on a benefit. Even just affording bus money to get to uni classes was a huge sacrifice. It\’d be either milk and nappies, or catch a bus and go to class. “There were very many days that you were hungry, and some days my dinner was whatever my kids had left over. That\’s just what the reality was, but I am so proud to have got through that. “I think the thing that always drove me was that I had reasons that were bigger than myself, which were my kids… This might sound a bit weird to people, but I probably wouldn\’t be here today if I just thought about myself. My kids were such a huge motivation to be someone better.” Despite her success in journalism in the years since then, Stewart hasn\’t forgotten her roots and has regularly used her platform to give a voice to Pasifika people and marginalised groups, whose stories too often go unheard. Last year, her story about high school students who were at school full-time, but also working the equivalent of full-time hours to support their families, sent shockwaves through the country and infused humanity into election cycle debates about poverty. Asked about her hopes for the future of journalism, Stewart told Rev Ritchie she wanted to do her bit helping repair public trust in media, which is now “well below” the global average, according to a 2024 report by the AUT Research Centre for Journalism, Media and Democracy. Stewart says while there are arguments to be made about why media is more trustworthy than it\’s perceived to be, she doesn\’t “discredit anyone feeling the way that they do” about it. She says growing up, she too didn\’t trust the media herself because she saw harmful narratives about brown people being perpetuated. “But there are also reasons many of us came to work in this industry: because we believe in the diversity of voices, the diversity of perspectives, and we believe in the truth being told,” she said. Stewart says the values instilled in her through her strong Christian faith has heavily shaped her reporting. “Growing up, I was always told about Isaiah 61. It talks about being anointed to preach the good news to the poor, to set the captives free, to bind the brokenhearted. And that\’s always been a huge value for me, not just in my life, but in journalism. “When we talk about preaching the good news, the good news to us is the gospel, and we were told the gospel of truth. When I take that scripture and apply it to my career, I think I\’m called to preach the truth… and the truth sets people free.” “When I\’ve thought about the young kids who have told me truths – whether it\’s having to work long hours, or suffering from some horrific abuse – that\’s the kind of truth that has set so many other people free.” Stewart says there are risks associated with truth-telling, but believes it\’s the most effective way for news outlets to win back the public\’s trust. “The truth is hard to hear, not everyone likes it. Some of the stories I\’ve done, I\’ve had major backlash with people not wanting those abuse stories to be told, people threatening my safety,” she said. “But if I let fear drive my career and drive the stories that I told, 85% of my career would be out the door. You have to be courageous to tell the truth.” In a wide-ranging interview, Stewart discusses her determination to be a role model to the next generation of Pasifika women, presenting the last ever 1News Midday bulletin, and reflects on her upbringing.']

    articleTextTwo = ['The Albanese government is planning to cap gambling ads during general TV programming, despite opposition from its backbench and a fresh push for a total ban by the Greens. On Monday the Greens communications spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, announced the minor party would attempt to amend an unrelated bill on television transmission to pass a total ban on gambling ads. In June 2023 a total ban was proposed by a bipartisan committee inquiry chaired by the late Labor MP Peta Murphy, but the government is set to respond with a partial ban. Under the proposal gambling ads would be banned online, in children\’s programming, during live sports broadcasts and an hour either side, but limited to two an hour in general TV programming. The package would not eliminate on-field signs and jersey logos, despite the Murphy report concluding they should also be banned. On Monday the backbench caucus committee heard the proposal. Several Labor MPs including Mike Freelander once again urged the government to commit to the total ban. Freelander, a paediatrician and the member for Macarthur in south-west Sydney, said his view was that a total ban would be “most appropriate from a public health point of view”. Jodie Belyea, who won the seat of Dunkley in a byelection, said she felt a “deep responsibility to honour” Murphy\’s legacy. “As a mum with a 17-year-old son, I am acutely aware of the prevalence of gambling advertising in sport,” she said. “As the government develops an effective package of reform specific to advertising, I will continue to advocate to my colleagues and the minister to address the recommendations championed by Peta.” Prof Steve Robson, the president of the Australian Medical Association, said he was “extremely keen” for the government to crack down “as much as possible, to send the message gambling is not healthy”. Robson agreed it is a “major public health issue”, citing dependence, mental health issues and an impact on all aspects of life including employment. Labor has been lobbied by the crossbench, former prime ministers John Howard and Malcolm Turnbull, former state premiers Dominic Perrottet and Steve Bracks, and Murphy\’s husband, Rod Glover, to adopt the total ban. Asked by independent Zoe Daniel about the partial ban in question time, Albanese replied there was a “fair bit of hypothetical about … our alleged position”. Albanese said the government was “working through these issues” and had acknowledged “the status quo, of saturation of gambling advertising where children are exposed to it, is untenable”. “We\’re taking a comprehensive approach, recognising that this is a complex issue.” Labor was tackling gambling harm “in a way that will ensure that there aren\’t unintended consequences”, he said. Although some gambling companies including Tabcorp were prepared to accept a ban, major sporting codes and media companies lobbied the government for a softer cap due to concerns about withdrawing a major source of revenue that may not be easily replaced by other advertisers. Hanson-Young said the Greens will move to amend a regional broadcasting bill, set to be debated in the Senate on Monday evening, to enact a total ban on gambling ads. “There\’s going to be a test for the government this week in the Senate,” she told reporters in Canberra. “We will use that bill to test the guts of this government to do the right thing.” FreeTV Australia has asked for revenue affected by ad restrictions to be “offset by reductions in the regulatory burdens on commercial broadcasters”. Asked about the issue of compensation, Hanson-Young said the Greens were prepared to talk about “what can be done to support community sport” but the government had to “come to the table and ban the ads first”. With lower house independent MPs and a hostile Senate crossbench including the Greens, David Pocock and Lidia Thorpe calling for a total ban, Labor will need bipartisan support from the Coalition to pass its cap proposal unamended. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, first proposed a ban on gambling ads during sports broadcasts and an hour either side in his 2023 budget reply but the Coalition is yet to state its position on the Labor proposal. On Monday the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, said that gambling ads were “offensive” and had “gone too far”, particularly having live odds advertised during games of football. “There needs to be some sensible policy put in place,” he told Sky News. “We\’re going to work with the government when they announce all their policy details.”',
                  'Australia\’s coal and gas exports cause more climate damage than those from any other country bar Russia, according to a new study that argues the country is undermining a global agreement to transition away from fossil fuels. The analysis, commissioned by the University of New South Wales\’ Australian Human Rights Institute, found Australia was the third biggest fossil fuel exporter on an energy basis in 2021, trailing only Russia and the US. Australia ranked second on an emission basis. It overtook the US due to a majority of Australia\’s exports being coal, a particularly emissions-intensive fuel. It meant that while Australia releases about only 1% of global emissions at home, it was linked to about 4.5% once its exports were counted. The report, by non-profit science and policy organisation Climate Analytics, said based on government forecasts, Australia\’s fossil fuel exports were expected to remain at roughly the current level until at least 2035 as it continued to approve new coal and gas export developments. Climate Analytics\’ chief executive, Bill Hare, said this was incompatible with a range of international commitments Australia had made, including a call backed by nearly 200 countries at the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai in December for the world to transition away from fossil fuels, “accelerating action this decade”. “Yet here we have the Australian government intent on a deliberate strategy that will see its gas exports soar, exporting billions of tonnes of emissions, inconsistent with achieving net zero, and completely inconsistent with the science of this issue,” he said. Dr Gillian Moon, the project lead of the Australian Human Rights Institute\’s climate accountability project, said it was striking that emissions from Australia\’s fossil fuels exports had been about 30bn of CO2 over the 63 years since 1961 and this was forecast to increase by 50% between now and 2035. She said the country was continuing on this path despite being more vulnerable to the effects of the climate crisis than most other countries. “We have domestic [emissions reduction] targets, but nothing on our exports. We export 91% of our coal and about three-quarters of gas, and we have no plan to get off this trade,” she said. “The Australian public deserve to know the truth about this and the consequences for us.” Moon said if Australia was serious about its climate commitments, it should be doing more to encourage countries that bought its fossil fuels – particularly the developed economies Japan, South Korea and Taiwan that take about two-thirds of its exports – to move more rapidly to renewable energy. She said it should be having similar discussions with like-minded fossil fuel exporters, such as Canada and Norway. She said it was striking that there was no discussion about fossil fuel production at global climate conferences held at the end of each year. “We have to have a conversation about how we\’re going to deal with this,” she said. The analysis found if the global community were to live up to the headline goal of the landmark Paris climate agreement – that countries would try to limit global heating to 1.5C – emissions from fossil fuels would need to be reduced by 64% by 2035. The report also said: Australian fossil fuel exports in 2023 were likely to lead to 1.15bn tonnes of CO2 – nearly three times as much was emitted from within the country. The country was responsible for 52% of global metallurgical coal exports and 17% of global thermal coal exports in 2022. Metallurgical coal is used in steel-making, thermal coal in electricity generation. Australia more than doubled its liquefied natural gas export capacity in the five years prior to 2020, adding 62m tonnes a year. Only 19% of gas extracted in Australia is used within the country. The rest was either exported or used as energy by the export industry. Australian governments and regulators had continued to grant permits for new large-scale gas production and LNG export projects in 2021 and 2022. This appeared at odds with a net zero roadmap released by the International Energy Agency, which found global gas use should decline 18-22% by 2030 and 47-53% by 2035 compared with 2022 levels. The Australian resources minister, Madeleine King, last month announced the government would award nine permits to six companies – four to Esso and one each to Beach Energy, Woodside, Chevron, Inpex and Melbana – to explore for new gas reserves off the country\’s west and south-eastern coasts. Data published by the Guardian this week found the Australian proposals were part of a surge of new oil and gas exploration by wealthy democracies – including the US, UK and Canada – that threatened to unleash nearly 12bn tonnes of planet-heating emissions and undermine national and global climate commitments. A recent report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a thinktank, challenged suggestions that Japan needed Australian gas to maintain its energy supply. It said demand for gas in the Asian country had fallen 25% over the past decade and the country was selling more LNG overseas than it bought from Australia.',
                  'Earth\’s string of 13 straight months with a new average heat record came to an end this past July as the natural El Niño climate pattern ebbed, the European climate agency Copernicus announced on Wednesday. But July 2024\’s average heat just missed surpassing last year\’s July, and scientists said the end of the record-breaking streak changes nothing about the threat posed by the climate crisis. “The overall context hasn\’t changed,” Copernicus\’s deputy director, Samantha Burgess, said in a statement. “Our climate continues to warm.” Human-caused climate change drives extreme weather events that are wreaking havoc around the globe, with several examples just in recent weeks. In Cape Town, South Africa, thousands were displaced by torrential rain, gale-force winds, flooding and more. A fatal landslide hit Indonesia\’s Sulawesi island. Beryl left a massive path of destruction as it set the record for the earliest category 4 hurricane. And Japanese authorities said more than 120 people died in record heat in Tokyo. Those hot temperatures have been especially merciless. The globe for July 2024 averaged 62.4F (16.91C), which is 1.2F (0.68C) above the 30-year average for the month, according to Copernicus. Temperatures were a small fraction lower than the same period last year. It is the second-warmest July and second warmest of any month recorded in the agency\’s records, behind only July 2023. The Earth also had its two hottest days on record, on 22 July and 23 July, each averaging about 62.9F. During July, the world was 2.7F (1.48C) warmer, by Copernicus\’s measurement, than preindustrial times. That\’s close to the warming limit that nearly all the countries in the world agreed to in the 2015 Paris climate agreement: 1.5C. El Niño – which naturally warms the Pacific Ocean and changes weather across the globe – spurred the 13 months of record heat, said Copernicus senior climate scientist Julien Nicolas. That has come to a close, hence July\’s slight easing of temperatures. La Niña conditions – natural cooling – aren\’t expected until later in the year. But there\’s still a general trend of warming. “The global picture is not that much different from where we were a year ago,” Nicolas said in an interview. “The fact that the global sea surface temperature is and has been at record or near record levels for the past more than a year now has been an important contributing factor,” he said. “The main driving force behind this record temperature is also the long-term warming trend that is directly related to buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.” That includes carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. July\’s temperatures hit certain regions especially hard, including western Canada and the western United States. They baked, with around one-third of the US population under warnings at one point for dangerous and record-breaking heat. In southern and eastern Europe, the Italian health ministry issued its most severe heat warning for several cities in southern Europe and the Balkans. Greece was forced to close its biggest cultural attraction, the Acropolis, due to excessive temperatures. A majority of France was under heat warnings as the country welcomed the Olympics in late July. Also affected were most of Africa, the Middle East and Asia, and eastern Antarctica, according to Copernicus. Temperatures in Antarctica were well above average, the scientists said. “Things are going to continue to get worse because we haven\’t stopped doing the thing that\’s making them worse,” said Gavin Schmidt, climatologist and director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, who wasn\’t part of the report. Schmidt noted that different methodologies or calculations could produce slightly different results, including that July may have even continued the streak. The primary takeaway, he said: “Even if the record-breaking streak comes to an end, the forces that are pushing the temperatures higher, they\’re not stopping. “Does it matter that July is a record or not a record? No, because the thing that matters, the thing that is impacting everybody,” Schmidt added, “is the fact that the temperatures this year and last year are still much, much warmer than they were in the 1980s, than they were preindustrial. And we\’re seeing the impacts of that change.” People across the globe shouldn\’t see relief in July\’s numbers, the experts said. “There\’s been a lot of attention given to this 13-month streak of global records,” said Copernicus\’s Nicolas. “But the consequences of climate change have been seen for many years. This started before June 2023, and they won\’t end because this streak of records is ending.”',
                  'It bills itself as a family network, but an investigation into Channel Seven has revealed it to be a "second chance club" for senior men, with allegations of bullying, sexism, assault and exploitation that have left staff hospitalised, unable to work and attempting suicide. In one case, a young female journalist became so distressed at her treatment, she ran in front of a car outside a Seven office. The Four Corners team has spoken to more than 200 people for this story, including current staff who have spoken out because they believe there is a desperate need for change at both Seven and in the broader commercial television industry. Legal complaints currently lodged with the network allege sexual discrimination, breaches of workplace laws and disability discrimination. There are three with the Sydney news division alone. Many former on and off-air staff who allege sexual harassment and bullying have been required to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that have silenced their right to tell their story. "They\’re trying to present an illusion of being robust, happy workplaces, performing a public interest in cutting-edge journalism," says solicitor Josh Bornstein, who has multiple clients at Seven and Nine. "What the NDAs do is mask the reality of a brutal workplace culture in which women particularly are mistreated very badly and routinely. "It\’s an unusually brutal culture. I haven\’t actually seen anything like it." One of Josh Bornstein\’s clients, who is suing the network for sexual discrimination, worked in Sydney as a journalist on Seven\’s Spotlight program. She describes it as a profoundly sexist workplace. Her legal claim cites one example in 2022 of entering an edit suite and seeing a pornographic picture on the wall. "It was of a woman with her legs spread and there was a very detailed drawing of a vagina and it was dripping," the woman says. "I just found that completely inappropriate and gross." She does not suggest that the executive producer was aware of it. It was revealed in April that Spotlight paid accused rapist Bruce Lehrmann\’s rent for a year and there was also an allegation — denied by Mr Lehrmann and Seven — that the network covered the costs of sex workers and cocaine. The Federal Court of Australia heard that Spotlight\’s male producers were living large, going on a golfing holiday to Tasmania with Mr Lehrmann, eating in expensive restaurants, including, famously, ordering a $361 tomahawk steak. That wasn\’t the experience of their female colleague — she consistently worked, her legal letter to Seven says, "10 to 12 hour days, 7 days a week". The letter said her senior male colleagues "left the office for hours at a time, to dine and consume alcohol at various restaurants in Martin Place … upon their return to the office, they frequently appeared significantly affected by alcohol." She says one male colleague — not the executive producer — blew the production budget on an overseas trip, drank so much he was "lying … on the ground, in the gutter" and, referring to a victim of sexual assault, told her: "Hey, hey, your job is to just to get this bitch\’s story." She says she had to spend her own money to finish the story, leaving her with no money for rent while waiting for Seven to reimburse her. "[It was] incredibly stressful". Things got so bad, the journalist says she became extremely unwell with a respiratory illness and was coughing up blood. She says her doctor found her oxygen levels were dangerously low and told her she needed to go home. "I just started sobbing because the pressure of going home and not going back to the office and what the retribution would be if I did that was so great," she says. "[The doctor] said, \’If you don\’t go home now, you\’re going to be in bed with pneumonia for six weeks … I\’ll call an ambulance to your office if I have to.\’" The journalist says her superiors expected her to keep working at home. "I got to the point where I was suicidal, and I remember in one particularly dark moment where I\’d worked all weekend," she says. "I rang Lifeline, and I made a doctor\’s appointment because I knew I was so close to taking my own life. And I had a child that I couldn\’t do that to because I was a single parent." The woman isn\’t the only Seven journalist who has contemplated suicide. In a disturbing incident in March this year, a young journalist ran in front of a car outside the network\’s Brisbane office at Mt Coot-tha and then threw herself down a hill because of her treatment there. She says she was working extremely long hours, including weekends, for a base salary just above the minimum wage. She was suffering from crippling anxiety and decided to look for other work. When the woman told Seven that she was leaving, she says she was told the company would not allow it — she would have to remain at the network for another six months. "The only way I can describe it is I felt like I had a noose around my neck," the young woman told Four Corners. She says she felt like she was "in a committed domestic violence relationship with [Seven News]". On March 8, the young woman\’s shaken colleague made contemporaneous notes of what he just witnessed happen to her. Four Corners has those notes. 1045 — received call from [my colleague]. Wailing, hysterical, incredibly emotional. Couldn\’t understand what she was saying apart from "they won\’t let me go", "i\’ve f**ked up my career", "I want to be hit by a car". Two minutes later, the young woman hung up and management was informed. "I just spiralled," the young woman told Four Corners. "I saw a car driving towards me up the road, I ran in front of it and hoped it would hit me. "It stopped. I kept running to find another car. I saw the edge of the cliff at Mt Coot-tha and I jumped. I tumbled down the hill, through the bush." At 10:50am, her colleague took a call from another Seven employee, who had just seen what had happened. He says [she] tried to jump in front of his car.. and he was now following her into bushland on the other side of studios. The men ran towards the bushland where she\’d thrown herself down the hill. 11.10 — 2 x [Queensland Ambulance Service] teams arrive The young woman was taken to hospital. She never returned to Seven. Seven declined to comment on the woman\’s case but said in a general statement that it had taken action to address issues that had been raised by Four Corners. "We are currently undertaking a reset of the culture," it said. "[We] want to be clear that the actions of some individuals do not reflect the values, behaviour and attitudes of the network as a whole." Reporter Olivia Babb is shaken, hearing what happened to her Brisbane colleague. "How do they sleep at night?" she says. "That\’s your work, that\’s where you spend all of your days and time and that\’s how they make you feel, that you have to end it? "They shouldn\’t be in business if that\’s what they\’re doing to young women." When we speak, the 36-year-old is working at Seven in regional Queensland, struggling to make ends meet on less than $60,000 a year. "It is one of the most degrading, soul-crushing places you can work," Babb says. She says her colleagues, who have tertiary journalism qualifications, need second jobs to pay their bills. "We did a story the other day and one of my [interview subjects] said, \’We\’re all one or two pay cheques away from homelessness.\’ That\’s me." She says she was "mortified, angry and embarrassed" by the allegations made in the Lehrmann defamation hearing that Spotlight covered the cost of sex workers and cocaine. These allegations were denied by Mr Lehrmann and the network. Babb, who has previously worked for the ABC for five months, says she has been harassed and bullied while working for Seven. She believes the public championing of men like Bruce Lehrmann is symptomatic of the way the network treats women behind closed doors. "You really think #MeToo has made any difference to Seven?" she asks. "I have never seen anything come through that makes us think that it even happened, that Seven even knew about #MeToo." Four Corners knows of other women who have ended up in hospital because of their treatment at Seven. One of them, a journalist who worked in Sydney, is also suing the network. The complaints in her chronology for her lawyer include: Persistent sexual harassment by a cameraman, which led her to text her then-boss: "That f**ker scares me and is most uncomfortable to work with … he\’s creepy and inappropriate." Her boss banned her from wearing glasses on camera because he said the network news director told him they make her "look like f**king Buddy Holly, don\’t f**king wear them again". Two male reporters in the newsroom wore glasses. When she refused to try to secure an interview with the husband of a woman who jumped off a cliff with her toddler, a manager threatened to send a reporter who was seven months pregnant. On 23 occasions she was forced to hand her story to a male reporter, often on traumatic stories including fatalities of children where she had worked late into the night. Seven did not comment on this woman\’s case but her lawyer, Josh Bornstein, says he has seen numerous examples of young women being routinely expected to give up their stories to men. His explanation for this and other patterns of behaviour he sees towards women journalists is "misogyny". "There\’s enormous hostility to women," Mr Bornstein says. Mr Bornstein is calling for the Human Rights Commission, as the "cop on the beat", to intervene and conduct an inquiry into commercial television. "It\’s unlike any industry I\’ve encountered in over 25 years of legal practice," he says. These issues are not confined to commercial TV. There have been allegations of sexual harassment at other media organisations too, including the ABC. Some staff who have complained to Seven management about their treatment have watched the company turn on them. One former Seven human resources (HR) worker, who asked to remain anonymous, said she was instructed to go through the emails of staff members who management had decided they wanted to get rid of, and construct false or misleading cases against them in order to terminate their contracts. "This was a tool. This was a widely used tool, a tactic, an approach, internally," she says. She is not the only former Seven HR staffer who has volunteered to us that this practice took place. "I feel sick to my stomach and I feel like it\’s a gross misuse of internal policies that are intended to be there for ethical reasons and a warping of those policies to suit … an orchestrated end result," she says. She says she also witnessed a sexist culture at Seven. "There appeared to be … a real disregard for any type of workplace policy or process or practice that supported gender equality. There was a real sexualisation of women, definitely, in the newsroom." She heard senior men in the news division commenting on women\’s appearance in an inappropriate and sexualised way. "There was very strong commentary and ongoing commentary around the size of a woman\’s breasts," she says, adding that the men were referring to an on-air presenter. One former news director remembers similar commentary, telling Four Corners he was blasted by a senior person in the company because a fill-in updates presenter had "no tits". "[It would be] stuff like, \’Who is this dog? She\’s got no tits,\’" the former news director remembers. "It would be awful, awful deeply misogynistic texts." Seven declined repeated requests from Four Corners for an interview but said in a statement: "Individuals who have displayed behaviour not reflective of Seven\’s values have been removed from the organisation. "Under new management, we have refreshed and recommunicated our policies and procedures and we encourage all Seven team members to call out any behaviour that does not reflect the values of Seven." For former Seven Perth star, Mark Gibson, there is a disconnect between how the network presents itself to the world and how it actually operates behind the scenes. "It often uses the phrase, \’It\’s the Sunrise family, it\’s the Telethon family, it\’s the Seven News family,\’" Gibson says. "It\’s a very dysfunctional family." Gibson says he is speaking out because "these sorts of toxic workplace behaviours can\’t be allowed to flourish anymore". Our investigation has exposed many instances where Seven management has ignored repeated complaints about senior men\’s behaviour towards staff. More often than not, those men kept their jobs. If they did not, they would later be given a second chance. A striking example is Mark Llewellyn. Ten years ago he was stood aside as executive producer of Seven\’s Sunday Night after he assaulted a male producer, ripping the front of his shirt. He was later brought back to run Seven\’s Spotlight where Four Corners has revealed he sent a Jewish producer anti-Semitic and offensive text messages. Llewellyn was forced to resign in April after Spotlight became embroiled in the Bruce Lehrmann scandal. Llewellyn said in a statement: "I categorically deny engaging in any conduct that is anti-Semitic or which constitutes bullying, discrimination or misconduct," he said. "A narrative has been created that it is simply untrue. That narrative has now been accepted by many as fact." The network did not answer specific questions about Llewellyn. The pattern of rehabilitating men can be traced back to at least the 2000s. In 2008, Mark Gibson was one of multiple Seven Perth staff who complained about the behaviour of former WA news director Shaun Menegola. Gibson says he witnessed him being "very irrational, often aggressive, verbally abusive, bullying, harassing, belittling". "I witnessed on two occasions him punching the wall in his office in absolute anger." Seven Perth\’s then-managing director Chris Wharton took staff concerns to management. The employees expected that Menegola would be sacked. He was not. "Chris Wharton rang me emotionally and said, \’I\’m so sorry. I feel like I\’ve failed you,\’" Gibson recalls. "\’I\’m so sorry … he can retain his job.\’" Three years later, in the face of persistent complaints, Menegola\’s contract as news director was not renewed. In a statement, Menegola acknowledged there were staff complaints which were "addressed and resolved years earlier", but said "my departure from 7 Perth in 2011 was in no way related" to those complaints. "It\’s true to say that I have always pushed teams and individuals to deliver the best results but it\’s not true to say that I would yell, scream and bully to get it done," he said. He went on to be news director at Channel Nine. Four Corners has spoken to multiple Nine staff who encountered similar behaviour to what Gibson says Menegola displayed at Seven. Former Nine reporter Mia Brankov was one of them. "The stories were rife of people saying how he\’s difficult to be around. He\’s an angry man, all sorts of stuff," Brankov says. "Some of these people … it\’s such a dark, dark time in their lives." When she decided it was too much and went to resign, Menegola refused to accept her resignation and "exploded" at her. "He said, \’You f***ing young journos, you sign these contracts and you think you can just walk away from them\’," Brankov recalls. Brankov says she was in tears, angry and upset. "I just called him a c**t." Menegola eventually left Nine. He said he "achieved an enormous amount at 9 Perth in a short time" and he "enjoyed working with the team". Mark Gibson says he and his Perth colleagues were astonished when, at the end of 2018, Menegola was hired as Seven Melbourne news director. "How on earth could he be rehired? He had a litany of complaints against him. It is beyond belief." "It\’s one thing to be treated badly," Gibson says, "It\’s another thing to see perpetrators of bad behaviour getting away with it … being promoted. "It\’s crushing, it\’s soul destroying." By the accounts of some in the Melbourne newsroom, Menegola\’s behaviour mellowed during his tenure there. Some staff there have told Four Corners they liked him as a boss. Menegola left Seven Melbourne in the wash-up of management resignations in April this year. He said he left "newsrooms with many lasting relationships". "I\’m proud of what we achieved as a team," Menegola says. Olivia Babb has now resigned from Seven. She says she wants to be the type of journalist who speaks out and fights for young women. "I will never be able to work at Seven again. But I don\’t want to work at Seven," she says. "They know what they\’re doing to us — they know everything. They don\’t care. "It\’s all just a big boys club."',
                  'When it comes to McDonald\’s, an $84 billion Australian superannuation fund and a small group of Texan nuns are united in their mission. Hesta and the Benedictine Sisters of Boerne are part of an investor movement using the stock market to lobby the world\’s biggest fast-food chain. They want the company to make burgers from animal products farmed with fewer antibiotics. The use of antibiotics in meat production has emerged as a new front of shareholder activism, similar to the lobbying that fossil fuel companies have been facing over climate targets. However, the investor group\’s push is divisive, with McDonald\’s hitting back and scientists raising questions about some of the policies being put forward. The unlikely antibiotic allies are resolute in their bid to bring about structural change, despite the criticism. "We intend to stay at the table," Sister Susan Mika, a representative of Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, told the ABC. So how did a group of Texan nuns and a major super fund end up in a cross-country battle with an American takeaway staple? The Benedictine Sisters of Boerne have a 32-year history of lobbying companies on issues such as water access and foreign workers\’ rights. Their activism was spearheaded by Sister Mika and others, quickly growing into a coalition of 26 monasteries across the United States and Mexico. However, the sisters didn\’t get interested in antibiotics reduction until about 10 years ago, when global attention was turning to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). AMR occurs when bugs that cause infectious disease can\’t be killed by the medicines designed to quash them, such as antibiotics. It has given rise to so-called "superbugs", with bacterial AMR contributing to the deaths of about 4.95 million people in 2019, according to data published in the Lancet. The problem is particularly acute in poorer countries, and it also affects farm animals when they face disease outbreaks. Even plants are facing superbugs. "It\’s really a significant problem," said Branwen Morgan, the lead at the Antimicrobial Resistance Mission at Australia\’s national science body, the CSIRO.  "And there\’s no time to wait. We all have a shared responsibility, trying to work out how we mitigate the impacts of AMR, which affects food security, biosecurity and economic security." It is those economic impacts that piqued Hesta\’s interest. "So antimicrobial resistance is a systemic threat to both global health and our ability to deliver strong long-term returns to our members," the fund\’s head of responsible investment, Kim Farrant, told the ABC. Ms Farrant cites modelling by the World Bank, which previously estimated that AMR – if left unchecked – could wipe out 3.8 per cent of the world\’s gross domestic product by 2050. The bank\’s high-impact scenario found global trade would drop, especially in agriculture as animals get sick, and that healthcare costs globally would soar.  "It\’s the same impact as the global financial crisis," Ms Farrant says of the World Bank\’s forecast. Hesta, which is a specialist superannuation fund for Australian healthcare workers, has also done surveys with its 1 million members about this topic, and found 80 per cent of them were aware of it. Members told the fund they were seeing diseases that were no longer treatable, and they were having to give patients multiple types of antibiotics and keep them in hospital longer. "And they had views on what Hesta should be doing as a fund to help address this issue," Ms Farrant says. While AMR is a natural phenomenon, the World Health Organisation (WHO) links the "overuse and misuse" of antibiotics in people, plants and animals to the exacerbation of this trend. "In Australia, we\’re really fortunate that we have quite strong regulation and practices [around antibiotic use in animals and humans]. But this is very much a global issue," Hesta\’s Kim Farrant says.  And this global approach has turned McDonald\’s into a target. Fairr, which is a global investor alliance working on risks in the world\’s food sector, identified the fast-food chain as the top company to lobby over this issue. That\’s due to its sheer size and ability to influence a massive network of agricultural suppliers, Fairr said. Fairr also highlighted other food companies, including KFC\’s parent company Yum! Brands, The Cheesecake Shop, Domino\’s Pizza, Starbucks, Wendy\’s and the owner of Burger King, Restaurant Brands International. All of these entities are listed on the world\’s biggest stock market on Wall Street, and are beholden to engaging with their shareholders as public companies. Hesta owns McDonald\’s stock — specifically 0.014 per cent of its market value — through an international fund, as well as shares in Yum! Brand\’s and US food giants Tyson and Hormel. It officially joined Fairr in 2020 to fight AMR before going on to lodge shareholder resolutions two years later. These are actions that are lodged by entities that own stocks in a company and are voted on by all other shareholders, and are a big part of the shareholder movement that is also fighting climate risks. Hesta\’s first AMR resolution was against Hormel, the American owner of tinned meat, Spam. The Hormel Foods resolution urged the company to conduct a study into the public health costs from the use of antibiotics in its supply chain. The vote received 14 per cent in favour, excluding management\’s 47 per cent ownership. The next year, Hesta lodged more resolutions, this time against three companies: Hormel, Tyson, and McDonald\’s. The action against McDonald\’s was done by Hesta in tandem with an advocacy group that is prominent on AMR, The Shareholder Commons, and another investment fund, Amundi. Their joint resolution on the NYSE called on McDonald\’s to comply with WHO guidelines on the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals. WHO has long recommended that antibiotics deemed medically important for human use be significantly restricted in food-producing animals. That includes the "complete restriction of these antibiotics for growth promotion and disease prevention without diagnosis". "Healthy animals should only receive antibiotics to prevent disease if it has been diagnosed in other animals in the same flock, herd, or fish population," the WHO recommended last decade. However, scientists said implementing these standards was easier said than done. Nations have varying approaches to antibiotic use and distinct interpretations of what is classified as medically important. That is despite WHO having its own global list, and experts recognising that lists vary from country to country, when national health priorities are considered. Outside of WHO, which is primarily concerned with human health, there are also advice lists from other specialist bodies, such as the World Organisation for Animal Health. In Australia, for instance, regulators don\’t use the phrase "medically important" but they do have rules around what can and can\’t be used in agricultural settings. "We have a relatively unique position in Australia," the CSIRO\’s Branwen Morgan said. Dr Morgan said those pushing new policies had to therefore be "very careful of unintended negative consequences". "Guidelines for antimicrobial use are very context dependent and locally dependent," she said. "We wouldn\’t want companies in the animal or food industry sector to stop using antimicrobials. Businesses with unhealthy animals aren\’t good businesses and economically viable businesses." She also said the most pressing issues in Australia were not the use of antibiotics on farms, but the overuse of them in humans and in the treatment of waste, which could spread into the environment. On a global scale, Dr Morgan said helping low socio-economic countries implement stronger rules on the use of antibiotics was a more important issue. In response to Hesta\’s resolution, McDonald\’s argued it was already doing plenty to eradicate unnecessary antibiotics in its supply chain, with policies that echoed WHO guidelines. The fast-food company released a policy in 2017 to eradicate medically important antibiotics of the highest priority from its chicken supply chain in "top markets". It also pledged to stop the use of antibiotics entirely in chicken for the purposes of growth promotion and for disease prevention in flocks.  However, this year, McDonald\’s said some markets still had not achieved these milestones, with the company hoping to fulfil its promise in 2027. It has not made similar pledges on pork or beef. "Our intention is to help drive positive behavioural change and transparency," it said in May. "As well as enable comprehensive assessment of antibiotic use across our in-scope supply chains and industries in the future." To this end, we are engaged in global partnerships across our supply chains to gather antibiotic use data, which helps inform the development, implementation, and evolution of our responsible protein-specific antibiotic use policies applicable for in-scope markets.  "Because each supply chain is unique, we must work in a targeted way to meet our commitments." McDonald\’s was contacted for comment about Hesta\’s and the Texan nuns\’ proposals but referred the ABC to its shareholder statements and declined to say anything further. In previous statements, it has called Hesta\’s push "duplicative" and "unnecessary", and recommended that all other shareholders vote against it. The resolution got 18 per cent support, excluding company management. The Shareholder Commons, which was the lead on the action, disputes McDonald\’s claim that their action was unnecessary and says the fast-food chain still isn\’t following WHO guidelines. Last year, an investigation by the Guardian found suppliers for McDonald\’s and other American chains like Walmart had antibiotics in their meats in ways that were "reckless". Hesta\’s Kim Farrant said the fund was satisfied with the results of its efforts, having also lobbied pharmaceutical companies to make changes. "Engagement is never a one-meeting sort of process," she said. "It occurs over a number of years and is intended to drive awareness and action. "We do hope to see further support from a range of investors as they also recognise this as a systemic risk." As part of their bid to create more awareness, Hesta moved its attention to lodging a similar AMR vote against the owner of KFC, Yum! Brands during Wall Street\’s shareholder meeting season in May. They received a similar result, while McDonald\’s was instead tackled by the sisters. In Texas, the sisters have been lobbying McDonald\’s for far longer than Hesta. In their 10 years of activism against the $194 billion company, they have achieved something that the fund has found difficult: getting meetings with McDonald\’s representatives. All because they hold just $US2,000 in McDonald\’s shares. "We own the stock, and so we said that we would step up and be the leader in order to raise questions with the company," Sister Mika said. "And that\’s how we look at this. It\’s a ministry to us." "When we first started raising questions [10 years ago] the company said they would start with chicken, which they did, and they have taken it out of the chicken across the US [and many other markets]. "So we\’re still working on the pork and the beef."  The sisters also started lodging shareholder resolutions against McDonald\’s a few years ago, with their latest lodged just a few months ago to tackle those meats. It called for McDonald\’s to phase out the use of all medically important antibiotics "for disease prevention purposes" in pork and beef products. "The basic premise of what we\’re talking about here is that there are antibiotics for animals and there\’s antibiotics for humans," Sister Mika says. The sisters\’ vote in May 2024 got just 15.16 per cent in favour, and another slap down from McDonald\’s, which vigorously defended its existing policies. "Our board unanimously recommends that you vote against this proposal," it noted. "Overall reduction remains an intended outcome, while allowing for the necessary treatment of sick animals, aligned with herd veterinarian direction." McDonald\’s didn\’t respond to multiple requests for comment from the ABC. However, the pressure on companies about antibiotics isn\’t going away. Last year, despite Australia being seen as having tight policies on agricultural use, supermarket giant Woolworths put out a brief policy on the use of antibiotics in its supply chain. Its rival Coles says it has one too, but that it is confidential. Meanwhile, other companies overseas have walked back on pledges after finding them too difficult to implement, including the US food giant Tyson, which backflipped on an antibiotics-free chicken pledge. "Consumers have a very powerful voice," the CSIRO\’s Dr Branwen says. "And sometimes they may not realise that what they\’re doing and calling for a particular action is actually going to have detrimental effects." Despite her reluctance to support any specific shareholder resolution, Dr Branwen thinks Hesta and the sisters have a role to play in fighting a global problem. "Shareholder action is a really powerful mechanism to make the broader community aware of the antimicrobial resistance problem globally," she said. "A key way that investors and insurers can help to focus on the AMR problem at large is by considering appropriate use and what that means." That includes measures to reduce the need for antibiotics, she said, such as developing better vaccines and giving farm animals better ventilation, so they don\’t get sick to begin with. Back in Texas, the sisters are about to enter their 10th year of engaging with McDonald\’s, and Sister Mika said they would be continuing that relationship as long as possible. "I think most companies want to improve," she said.  "And so we\’re in it for the long haul. We intend to stay at the table for as long as possible."',
                  'Sydney coach John Longmire has fired back at Collingwood counterpart Craig McRae over the "extraordinary admission" in his comments about a contentious umpiring decision. McRae was left seething when whistleblowers did not award Dan McStay a 50-metre penalty in the dying stages of the Magpies\’ three-point loss to the Swans last Friday night. In the immediate aftermath, McRae said "it would have been paid at the MCG" and also highlighted what he felt was a "circus" surrounding insufficient intent calls during the match. Longmire laughed on Monday when asked by reporters for his opinion about McRae\’s comments. "It was an extraordinary admission from the coach of a team that has the biggest home-ground advantage in the AFL," Longmire said. "This year they play 14 games at the MCG (and) they play three at Marvel (Stadium). "That\’s 17 games essentially in front of their home crowd, and they play finals and obviously the grand final on their home deck. "I wonder what (Brisbane Lions coach) Chris Fagan thought of those comments. "That was my initial thought, \’I wonder what Chris Fagan thinks of this?\’ "Because it\’s a pretty extraordinary admission from the club that has the biggest home-ground advantage in the competition." Fagan\’s Brisbane suffered an agonising four-point defeat to Collingwood in last year\’s grand final at the MCG, where they were on the wrong end of a late umpiring decision. Advantage was called on Lions forward Zac Bailey, who seemingly hadn\’t heard the whistle after a free-kick was paid to teammate Lachie Neale. Bailey\’s rushed kick under pressure was cleared by Collingwood, who then hung on for a famous flag triumph. Longmire laughed again when asked if McRae\’s comments on Friday night had "soured" Sydney\’s victory. The premiership coach then suggested Collingwood had got away with an infringement late in their come-from-behind win over North Melbourne in June. The AFL later clarified umpires were right not to penalise Magpies players for stepping over the mark. "I was at the North Melbourne-Collingwood game (in round 14) when a couple of Collingwood boys went over the mark and it could\’ve been a 50 and it wasn\’t paid," Longmire said. "I just think from the coach of a team with the biggest home-ground advantage, including grand finals at the MCG … geez. "You don\’t often hear it from the team with the biggest home-ground advantage, do you? "I can\’t say whether I agree with it or not because I\’m going to stay out of that." The AFL is yet to make a statement on whether a 50-metre penalty should have been handed to McStay. Sydney retained top spot on the ladder with their come-from-behind win on Friday night, while Collingwood\’s finals hopes are now out of their hands. The Magpies must win their two remaining games against Brisbane and Melbourne, and have other results fall their way.',
                  'Au revoir Paris, merci beaucoup! What an Olympic Games! From a float down the Seine, to Tom Cruise rappelling off the roof of the Stade de France, the 2024 Games have been full of memories and moments. And for Australia, those moments came thick and fast. Our best Games in history, 18 gold, 19 silver and 16 bronze. Our best overseas haul of 53 medals, finishing fourth on the tally board overall. There was only one day out of the 17 where we didn\’t win a medal of some sort. We cried alongside BMX rider Saya Sakakibara winning gold as a tribute to her family, we all wanted to adopt 14-year-old skateboader Arisa Trew, we flew over the bar with pole vaulter Nina Kennedy, kangaroo hopped with break dancer Raygun - who even gave an impromptu performance to the roars of her Australian teammates before the closing ceremony. Perhaps Paris 2024 president Tony Estanguet summed the Games up best with this description at the closing ceremony. "[It was] heart-racing, head-spinning, screaming, crying, crazy love," he said. "One day, life is normal, the next it feels magical. It\’s what we have felt since July 24." "We knew you would be brilliant, but you were magic. The most difficult part of any love affair is saying goodbye, so of course we don\’t want it to end." IOC President Thomas Bach added: "Despite all the tensions in our world, you made the City of Light shine brighter than ever before. Thank you for making us believe in a better world for everyone. Perhaps Paris 2024 president Tony Estanguet summed the Games up best with this description at the closing ceremony. "[It was] heart-racing, head-spinning, screaming, crying, crazy love," he said.

IOC President Thomas Bach added: "Despite all the tensions in our world, you made the City of Light shine brighter than ever before. Thank you for making us believe in a better world for everyone. But these Games have been about more than that. There have been steps forward in terms of gender equality and sustainability. And Paris just looked great. Cruise did his best to steal the show at an extraordinary au revoir to the Paris Olympics, descending from the top of the Stade de France on a cable to mark the handover of hosting duties to Los Angeles 2028. Yet even Hollywood\’s biggest superstar must have known his splendid cameo at the closing ceremony couldn\’t possibly upstage the most magnifique of all Olympics. For LA, it should be known - that\’s Mission Impossible. But what a way to end two fantastic weeks in the French capital. The 62-year-old\’s daredevil act on Sunday night was cheered to the rafters that he\’d abseiled from by 80,000 cheering supporters, and thousands more of the world\’s best athletes who\’d thronged to France\’s national stadium. They included a huge contingent from Australia\’s record-breaking team, revelling one last time as they prepared to bring home a record 18 gold medals. They were led by their flagbearers, 28-year-old repeat champion sailor Matt Wearn, who\’d achieved his victory in the Marseille regatta, and double gold medallist from the pool, the great Kaylee McKeown. And in the parade of champions there were a host of their other victors, including golden girl, double canoe slalom champion Jess Fox, later introduced as one of the new members of the IOC Athletes Commission. The Aussies were in understandably buoyant mood, dancing on the track to \’Freed from Desire\’, amid the extraordinary sight of the world\’s best sportsmen and women bouncing up and down in unison to the Gala hit. But after another spectacular son et lumiere show on the theme of Olympic records, fresh from the vivid imagination of creative director Thomas Jolly, whose opening ceremony had caused plenty of waves, the fun really only started properly when the handover to LA began. Still, Cruise wasn\’t the biggest star of the night for the home audience, who broke into cheers and chants of "Leon, Leon!" when Paris 2024\’s equivalent of Cathy Freeman in 2000, golden swimmer Leon Marchand, turned up with the flame. Now it\’s all done and dusted. But we\’ll always have Paris!',

                  'This month, the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attraction (DBCA) Parks and Wildlife Services will host fun and educational events at Calgardup Cave to celebrate Natural Science Week. Guided by the theme, "Species Survival: More than just sustainability", the events will explore the fascinating world of biodiversity. Key highlights will be workshops dedicated to the crucial role of invertebrates in maintaining forest health. Tiny creatures such as earthworms, land snails, millipedes, and spiders, collectively known as invertebrates, may seem small and insignificant; however, they are vital in maintaining the balance of our forest ecosystem. Attendees will have the opportunity to assist in surveying these creatures (macrofauna) in the bushland surrounding Calgardup Cave. Through these hands-on activities, participants will gain insights into macrofauna\’s fundamental roles within the ecosystem and learn about the endangered cave fauna reliant on these habitats. "Invertebrates make up around 95 percent of animal biodiversity in Australia, yet most species remain undescribed and are poorly understood," DBCA said. "We want to encourage people of all ages to become citizen scientists by fostering an interest in biodiversity," Cave Manager Carolina Paice said. "This includes exploring and studying the cave environment and appreciating the rich diversity of life that has evolved over millions of years in this biodiversity hotspot." The workshops aim to educate citizen scientists on how they can assist researchers in bridging information gaps and contributing to safeguarding the foundations of our incredible ecosystem\’s beautiful biodiversity. And for all the budding nature photographers out there, Caves staff will provide valuable tips on photographing macrofauna and submitting observations to iNaturalist, an essential platform for environmental data. Participants will also have the chance during the first weekend to interact with remember of the caving club community. Mike Longman from Cavers Leeuwin Incorporated (CLINC), will be on hand to discuss cave surveying and mapping. "I\’ve been caving for the last 45 years and love sharing my passion with other people," Mr Longman said. "These workshops are a great opportunity to show the public how science is integral to understanding and protecting caves." The event excitement continues into the second weekend with bat specialist Kelly Sheldrake from the WA Speleological Society (WASG), who will be surveying bat activity. "It\’s exciting to share knowledge of our bats because many people don\’t realise we have them," Ms Sheldrake said. "They\’re so beneficial, but there\’s a lot of misinformation and a negative perception of these amazing creatures." "Sadly, this has had an impact on bat conservation. "We can do something positive by sharing the value and appreciation of bats with others. "We have a few species found only in our southwest, which is really exciting and special." Cave specialists Jay and Ross Anderson (CLINC) will also be available to discuss cave fauna. Workshops are designed for adults and older children; however, engaging activities for younger children will be available, making this an exciting and informative day for the whole family.',
                  'High-profile Aussies are calling for a ban on gambling ads, including former prime ministers Malcolm Turnbull and John Howard. High-profile anti-gambling advocates, politicians and two former Prime Ministers have urged the Government to commit to stronger gambling reforms, including a ban on gambling ads. The Federal Government is expected to introduce legislation to restrict TV gambling ads. However, the proposed measures have been criticised for not going far enough, after a federal inquiry recommended banning them altogether. It coincides with a newly published list, which shows dozens of current MPs have accepted gifts from the gambling industry since 2019. A federal inquiry into gambling harms made 31 recommendations in June 2023. The “you win some, you lose more” report proposed a phased ban of all TV, radio, and online gambling ads within three years. The inquiry was led by Labor MP Peta Murphy, who died in December. Speaking in Parliament today, Independent MP Zoe Daniel quoted Murphy\’s husband, Rod Glover, as having urged the Government to “put people first” and implement the recommendations. The Government has not yet responded to the report\’s proposals. Last week, Nine newspapers reported that the Government was considering limiting gambling ads during sports broadcasts to two per hour. TDA reached out to Communications Minister Michelle Rowland, who did not directly address these reports, but said: “The status quo of online wagering advertising is untenable”. She added the Government was continuing to speak with “harm reduction advocates, health experts and industry” before it tables legislation in Parliament. Advocacy groups have intensified calls for the Government to ban all gambling ads. An open letter from the Alliance for Gambling Reform said a “tsunami” of “one million gambling ads” are shown on free-to-air TV and radio every year. The letter was signed by high-profile figures including former Coalition Prime Ministers John Howard and Malcolm Turnbull. The alliance described said a national “gambling addiction” is costing Australians $25 billion annually. Calls for gambling ad regulations coincide with new data about the volume of expensive gifts being given to politicians by the gambling industry. Federal MPs and Senators are legally required to declare any gifts from third parties worth more than $300. This can include sporting tickets and dinners. Declarations are recorded on the federal gift registry. Open Politics conducted an independent analysis of the gift registry. The volunteer-run organisation found that 48 current Coalition and Labor politicians have accepted gifts from the gambling industry since May 2019. The most publicly-declared gifts were given to Coalition MP Dan Tehan, at 31. Labor\’s Michelle Rowland – who oversees gambling in her ministerial duties – came in second, after she received 27 gifts from the gambling industry. In his budget reply speech last year, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton said he wanted to ban all gambling ads during sporting events. Zoe Daniel has also called for a total ban on betting ads. She is one of multiple crossbenchers pressuring the Government to introduce legislation urgently. “The government has to find the courage to stare down the corporate gambling giants, the media conglomerates, and the sporting codes, and do the right thing,” Daniel said.

                  'Patients with IUDs report experiencing pain ranging from mild to severe discomfort during the insertion process. Health officials in the U.S. have announced new guidelines to address the pain associated with IUD insertion. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are small devices placed through the cervix into the uterus, most commonly to prevent pregnancy. Patients with IUDs report experiencing pain ranging from mild to severe discomfort during the insertion process. Updated federal health advice means healthcare providers in the U.S. should inform patients about this potential pain, and offer them pain management options ahead of the procedure. IUDs are one of the most effective forms of birth control, with a 99% efficacy rate. The device, shaped like a small “T,” prevents sperm from reaching an egg. There are two types of IUDs: Hormonal and copper. Hormonal IUDs (e.g. the Mirena and Kyleena) can last up to eight years, depending on the brand, while copper IUDs are approved for up to 10 years. The popularity of IUDs has increased steadily over the past 30 years. According to UN figures, an estimated 17% of women (15-49 years) use an IUD for contraception, worldwide. In recent years, there has been increased awareness and concern about the pain associated with IUD insertion — a process that typically lasts between five and 20 minutes. Side effects can include cramping, nausea, dizziness and, in some cases, severe pain. According to a 2019 U.S. study of adolescents and young women, 80% of IUD users “experienced moderate to severe insertional pain”. Over-the-counter medication remains a widely recommended pain relief option. Some patients choose to have their IUD inserted under local and general anesthetic, but many clinicians do not offer this option. Less than 5% of American doctors offered local anesthetic for the procedure, 2019 figures show. Findings published in the European Journal of Contraception & Reproductive Health Care suggest doctors underestimate patients\’ pain levels during the procedure. “Patients\’ reported pain levels were significantly higher than those reported to have been observed by their providers,” it found. This week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) responded to concerns by advising doctors to discuss pain management options with patients before IUD insertion. The public health regulator recommends broadening pain-relief options to include other anesthetic gels, creams and spray options. The new guidelines acknowledged that “concerns about anticipated pain with placement” can prevent patients from accessing an IUD. The CDC also noted patients “should be counselled on… the risks, benefits, and alternatives of different options for pain management,” before IUD placement. Professor Kirsten Black, Professor of Sexual and Reproductive Health at the University of Sydney, said that while “most people can tolerate [IUD insertion] as an awake procedure,” all patients should have access to pain relief. “It\’s important definitely to warn women about the pain and ideally you advise them to take some pain relief before they come for the procedure,” she said. Black noted that “topical anesthetic on the cervix” can also “help with some parts of the procedure, but that\’s not always available.” She conceded that most women do find the experience at least somewhat uncomfortable. However, Black told TDA “if you counsel women well before the procedure and they take some pain relief and you\’re able to offer some topical anaesthetic… the vast majority of women will tolerate it really well.”',
                  'Three alleged 9/11 terrorists will plead guilty in Guantánamo Bay, guaranteeing life in prison instead of death penalties. The alleged mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks and two other accused terrorists will plead guilty in U.S. offshore prison Guantánamo Bay. Khalid Sheikh Mohammad and two of his alleged accomplices have been detained since 2003 over their involvement in the attacks. After agreeing to a plea deal to avoid the death penalty, the three men are expected to be handed life sentences. On 11 September 2001, terrorists from the Islamist extremist group al-Qaeda hijacked four commercial U.S. flights. Two were deliberately crashed into New York\’s World Trade Centre (the Twin Towers) killing 2,977 people. One of the planes crashed into the U.S. Department of Defense in Virginia (the Pentagon), killing 184 people. Passengers and crew successfully diverted the fourth plane from its planned target, Washington, D.C. It crashed in a field in Pennsylvania, killing all 44 people on board. In the wake of the attacks, then-President George Bush signed new U.S. military powers into law. The legislation gave officials protections to use “all necessary and appropriate force” against any person, organisation, or country responsible for the attacks. Once the laws passed, the Bush administration declared a \’Global War on Terror\’ and the U.S. invaded Iraq. The CIA led a decade-long manhunt for al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden, who was killed by U.S. forces in Pakistan in 2011. Dozens of others were arrested during this time over suspected ties to the terrorist group. Khalid Sheikh Mohammad was captured by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Pakistan in 2003. Mohammad\’s two alleged accomplices, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, were also arrested in 2003. The three men were transferred to the U.S. military prison at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba in 2006, where they have been held ever since. Later in 2007, Mohammad admitted to authorities he was the architect of the 9/11 attacks. The 9/11 suspects were expected to eventually face trial at Guantánamo Bay. Originally a U.S. naval station, it was first used as an offshore detention facility for suspected war criminals in 2002. Around 800 people have been detained in Guantánamo Bay since then. 30 remain. Human rights groups including Amnesty International have repeatedly accused the CIA of using Guantánamo Bay as a site to torture and abuse prisoners. These groups have also raised concerns over the ongoing detention of several prisoners without fair trials. A 2014 U.S. Senate report revealed evidence the CIA had tortured Mohammad extensively after he was captured. According to the findings, the CIA \’waterboarded\’ him “at least 183 times”, and kept him awake for seven and a half days straight. Waterboarding is a form of torture when a person has water poured over their face while their mouth and nose are covered. The report found that torture – which the CIA called “enhanced interrogation techniques” – led to poor quality information from detainees, including lies. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Walid bin Attash, and Mustafa al-Hawsawi are charged with 3000 counts of murder. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, the three prisoners struck a plea deal to avoid the death penalty. They\’re expected to formally enter their guilty pleas by October, possibly earlier. In a letter to families of 9/11 victims, the Pentagon confirmed the prisoners will plead guilty, and will be sentenced to life in jail. Two support groups, \’9/11 Families United\’ and \’9/11 Justice\’, have expressed their disappointment about the “closed-door agreements” of the plea deal. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson also called the arrangement “unthinkable”. “The families of those murdered by these terrorists have waited for justice. This plea deal is a slap in the face of those families,” Johnson said.',
                  'Scarface actor Ángel Salazar has died at the age of 68. Though best known as Al Pacino\’s trusted sidekick Chi Chi in the Brian DePalma-directed gangster film, Salazar had a long and prolific career. Salazar\’s rep and closest friend, Ann Wingsong revealed that the actor died in his sleep at his friend\’s Brooklyn home over the weekend, per TMZ. Wingsong told the outlet that on Sunday morning, the friend went to check on Salazar in a room and found his body in bed. The cause of death was not disclosed, but the rep said Salazar suffered from heart issues. The Cuban-American comedian and actor was known for saying “Sheck it out” before, during, and after jokes during his stand-up routine. Only five roles into his acting career, Salazar landed the part of Chi Chi, the devoted henchman of Pacino\’s Tony Montana in the 1983 cult classic Scarface. Fans of the film will forever remember Chi Chi saving Tony\’s life during the suspenseful and bloody “chainsaw scene.” They\’ll also find it hard to forget Chi Chi\’s demise when his back gets filled with lead thanks to a hit squad hired by drug kingpin Alejandro Sosa (Paul Shenar). Salazar later worked opposite Tom Hanks in the 1988 David Seltzer-directed dramedy, Punchline. he story revolves around a talented young comic who helps a housewife break into stand-up comedy. Salazar, a comedian in real life, appeared on Last Comic Standing and numerous HBO comedy specials The comedian/actor would reteam with Pacino and DePalma in the 1993 crime drama Carlito\’s Way. Other notable credits include Walk Proud, The Wild Life, Sylvester, Hot to Trot, and Maniac Cop 2, among other titles. Salazar\’s last credited roles were in 2022\’s The Black Ceaser and 2023\’s The Gilbert Diaries: The Movie.',
                  'Rental giant Airbnb has hit out at claims they\’re contributing to Australia\’s property crisis. Lending indicator data released in February by the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed the national average new mortgage size as of December 2023 was the highest on record at $624,383. The national average rent cost was $600 per week over the June quarter; $640 per week for capital cities and $540 per week in the regions, while the rental vacancy rate sat at a measly 1.4 per cent in June, according to PropTrack\’s June Rental Report. “Prior to the pandemic era, the national rental vacancy rate was typically around 2.5 per cent, indicating just how much conditions have tightened,” the report stated. “With limited new rental supply and persistent strong demand for rentals, the vacancy rate is anticipated to remain low. “This highlights again how a significant lift in rental stock or reduction in rental demand is required to see more stable rental conditions similar to pre-pandemic.” Rental companies including Airbnb have been widely criticised over claims of hiking up rent prices and curbing the availability of long-term rentals. However Airbnb Australia and New Zealand country manager Susan Wheeldon has claimed short-term rentals only make up a small portion of available rentals. “All of short-term rentals sit at around 1 per cent of overall stock in Australia,” Ms Wheeldon told 7NEWS. Byron Bay is set to introduce caps on short term rental accommodation from September, prohibiting people from renting out non-hosted properties for more than 60 days per year for most of the Shire. Byron Shire Mayor Michael Lyon told 7NEWS protecting residential areas for residential uses is “absolutely essential”. “We know we\’re under assault from the platforms,” he said. However Ms Wheeldon claimed the move could have a “really serious impact on employment”. It comes after it was revealed no one on the average NSW median part-time or full-time income can afford to purchase a property in Greater Sydney without extra support, according to new research led by property experts Mustapha Bangura (University of Technology Sydney) and Professor Chyi Lin Lee (UNSW). “While we expected the issue of housing affordability to be severe for part-time employment, we found that full-time employees are also significantly affected,” Professor Lee said. “This highlights the widespread housing affordability crisis and the need for comprehensive policy solutions. “It\’s clear the Australian dream of owning a home is becoming increasingly harder to attain.”',
                  'Bombshell news has dropped over injured Melbourne superstar Christian Petracca and his future at the Demons. The 28-year-old Petracca is recovering from the horrific injuries he suffered in the King\’s Birthday clash against Collingwood back in June that were “likened to a car crash”. Petracca was crunched by Collingwood\’s Darcy Moore in a marking contest in the first quarter and was left with four broken ribs, a lacerated spleen and a small puncture in a lung, requiring emergency surgery to stop the bleeding. During the midfielder\’s absence, the Demons have slipped from likely AFL finalists and potential flag contenders to 13th on the ladder with a 10-11 record and highly unlikely to feature in September.Now alleged uncertainties over the direction of the club have prompted Petracca to consider seeking a trade, according the Channel 9\’s Tom Morris. “Christian Petracca is disgruntled and particularly disillusioned with the club\’s direction,” Morris reported on Monday evening. “Petracca\’s a pro, he\’s desperate for another flag, but he has become increasingly unhappy in the wake of his season-ending spleen injury. “His disenchantment — which is not directed at the coach (Simon Goodwin), it must be said — has now become so palpable that if he was out of contract, the four-time All-Australian would likely ask for a trade tomorrow. “But the reality is he has five years left on his contract and it\’s basically impossible to see how the Dees would agree to let their best player go, even if he did demand a trade.” Speaking on Fox Footy\’s On the Couch, Melbourne great Garry Lyon was taken aback by the report before offering a measured, albeit passionate, response. “I\’d need to hear that from Christian. It\’s the first I\’ve heard of it,” he said. “I\’m not troubled by it until I hear it from Christian, OK? “If I could eyeball Christian Petracca and say \’you signed a seven-year deal for $1.2 (million), they\’ve taken you to the promised land, they\’ve set you up for life and now you want to get out?\’ Then I\’d be troubled.” Petracca required multiple surgeries to recover from his injuries, following the move to allow the premiership winner to go back onto the ground after the collision. His family and Melbourne fans were left frustrated by the handling of the incident, with a grey looking Petracca clearly in major distress when he returned to the field, although he later took responsibility for that decision. Not surprisingly, Morris said a rival club is already monitoring the situation surrounding the top-rated talent. “For now teammates are aware of his frustrations, some even share them, key officials are aware too, but standing firm he will not be traded under any circumstances,” Morris added. “One rival club also understands how unsettled Petracca is and they\’re watching the situation closely.”',
                  'Shoppers are obsessed with new sets of Kmart pyjamas and are comparing them to high-end options like Kim Kardashian\’s brand SKIMS. Sal and Al from the podcast Two Broke Chicks recently shared a now-viral video to their Instagram page discussing the Kmart pyjamas in question. “Kmart pyjamas have come to slay. People are loving these pyjamas because they are so affordable and the quality is chef\’s kiss,” explained the girls. “They\’re also cute which is also important. It\’s interesting because Kmart actually have a stronger sustainability score than SKIMS, but the SKIMS ones are around $200.” Kmart\’s pyjamas start at $12 and come in a range of different styles, colours and sizes. The Pointelle Cami Romper for $15 has a five-star rating on Kmart\’s website. Shoppers are saying “it\’s so comfy to sleep in” and is made from elastane and cotton with pointelle fabric. Another popular pyjama set from Kmart is the Long Sleeve and Slouchy Shorts Pyjama set, which is $22. The set comes in either blue or pink and is made from a combination of polyester, viscose, elastane and single jersey fabric. The pyjama set also has a five-star rating on Kmart\’s website and shoppers are saying they are “so soft and comfy”. Sal and Al\’s video about the PJs received more than 180,000 views and people in the comments were quick to agree with them. “Not me wearing mine while watching this,” said one. “They are honestly so darn comfy,” added a second. “Can confirm these pyjamas are amazing,” said a third. “I have them, hands down the best pyjamas I\’ve ever purchased, so comfy,” added another.',
                  'A group of visitors to a popular beach in Sydney\’s eastern suburbs are being slammed over an alleged illegal act with local wildlife. The beachgoers were seen at Maroubra\’s North End gathering around and taking photos of a fur seal on the rocks. An image, shared to social media by Barry Ion, showed a dozen people gathered just metres away from the animal and appearing to be well inside the minimum legal distance. “People are getting way too close, some almost touching it. It\’s intimidating and it can attack,” Barry said. The act outraged locals on social media, who shared their disappointment in the group\’s behaviour. “Bloody humans can\’t help themselves! Stay away!” one person said. “Let the animal be in its natural environment!” another added. “Please respect and don\’t scare the seal,” a third said. In NSW, there is a legal distance people must keep from seals under the Biodiversity Conservation Regulation 2017. According to the NSW Parks and Wildlife Service, approach distances for seals are based on where the seal is located and if a pup is present. “A seal is considered a pup if it is up to half the length of the adult,” NPWS said. \’”If a seal comes towards you, you must move back to the minimum approach distance.” When a seal is on the land, you must keep at least: 40m away from the seal 80m from a seal pup 100m away from the seal for a drone Meanwhile, the Organisation for the Rescue and Research of Cetaceans in Australia (ORRCA) said earlier in the month it was responding to a high number of seals coming ashore due to the current extreme rough ocean conditions. “We are monitoring seals from the South Coast to Northern NSW,” they said. “We ask that especially during the next few days, if you are out near the ocean, please keep a lookout for any seals.” 7NEWS.com.au has reached out to NPWS for further information.',
                  'Tradespeople across Brisbane have opened up how much money they earn in their respective jobs. From fire technicians to traffic controllers, the workers revealed a huge variation in pay packets depending on the trade and the level of experience. The Queensland tradespeople spilled their salary secrets during roving interviews with representatives from Brisbane-based job search startup GetAhead last week. The highest earner of the bunch was an underground coal miner, earning an annual salary of about $300,000 per year. That\’s about double the average wage of a miner in Australia, according to Seek data based on full-time salary ranges disclosed by employers on job ads. But the coal miner also clarified that he owns the business he works for. The second-highest salaries were revealed by a crane operator who said he earns over $200,000 annually, and a fire technician who said that same figure was at the top end of his annual earning capacity, matching the average earnings for the roles. A diesel fitter who spoke to GetAhead said he earned up to $180,000 annually, which matches the average earnings in the role, and one electrician said he earned $150,000 per year, a bump up from the average, according to Seek data. Many of the tradies interviewed by GetAhead revealed their annual earnings could vary hugely, and Fair Work award guidelines show just how much overtime pay rates and a high classification of industry experience can impact wages in the trades. For the electrical trade, the hourly pay rate difference between a grade 1 worker and a grade 10 worker, is more than $16 per hour — and those rates balloon for overtime, unrostered shifts, Sundays and public holidays. A highly experienced electrician working on a public holiday, for example, can earn over $115 per hour — and on the other end of the scale, a first year apprentice in the trade would earn just $12.25 per hour on an average weekday. One traffic controller told GetAhead he made about $35 per hour, the same hourly earnings disclosed by one tree lopper who additionally revealed a surprisingly large earning capacity. “One week there I made $26,000 cash for one of my bosses, and he was spinning out,” he told GetAhead. And a tiler, who said he works on Enterprise Bargaining Agreement (EBA) sites, revealed earnings of $70 per hour, on top of the additional hourly allowances based on the project value and the height of the work site. A glassworker said he earns about $1100 per week, which is just below the median earnings for the role ($1341), according to Jobs and Skills Australia. A steel fixer interviewed by GetAhead said he earned $1200 per week, and one labourer revealed he earned about $1500 per week. And an abseiler said that when he works at nights, he earns about $4000 per week. That\’s almost double that of the poly welder/operator, who revealed he earns the same figure in a fortnight. ',
                  'There has been a breakthrough in an intriguing case A Current Affair reported on last month. Sydney man Andre Azar said his trust was abused after his vehicle was allegedly stolen in an online car sale gone wrong. The Azars wanted a quick sale, so they listed it for $5000 to $6000 less than market value and were contacted within hours by prospective buyers. That night the prospective buyers, a young couple, were welcomed into the Azar family home, in Sydney\’s south west. They told Andre their names and they even showed him NSW Government issued photo IDs. What followed was a hard-luck story that resulted in a cheque deposited into Azar\’s account and his vehicle registered to another owner despite there being no paperwork.

                  'Liberal Senator Linda Reynolds believed Bruce Lehrmann\’s rape trial was politically motivated and Peter Dutton undermined her, a psychologist\’s notes read to a defamation trial have revealed. Senator Reynolds is suing Brittany Higgins for defamation over a series of social media posts containing alleged mistruths that she believes damaged her reputation. On day seven of the Perth trial, the senator\’s psychologist April Jones told the court she started counselling the politician after media reported Higgins\’ accusations about the senator mishandling her alleged rape. "She had an incident in parliament where she had become very distressed," Jones told the Western Australian Supreme Court on today. Her notes detailed the pair\’s ongoing sessions, including the senator\’s thoughts in late 2022 when Lehrmann was on trial for rape. "If this wasn\’t political it wouldn\’t have gone to court, pre-orchestrated by Brittany and her boyfriend," one of the notes read to the court said. During another session in 2023, Jones wrote "Linda stated Peter Dutton undermined me" but couldn\’t provide further details about what it meant. Senator Reynolds\’ long-time partner Robert Reid told the court the senator didn\’t tell him about Higgins\’ alleged rape in 2019 and learned about it from media reports in 2021. Reid said he was annoyed and cover-ups were dangerous for senior ministers. "I said \’who did you tell? Surely you told the prime minister ... and she said \’it\’s not my story to tell," he said. "Brittany had asked Linda not to tell anyone about it, Linda kept that promise." Reid said it was difficult to watch Higgins\’ interview on Network Ten\’s The Project when she accused Senator Reynolds of mishandling her alleged rape. "I couldn\’t believe what I was what I was hearing. The accusations about a cover-up, about threats of jobs," he said. "Painful to watch. Linda was really angry. "Here was a story being told that was not true." Reid suggested the senator should prepare for parliament question time the next day. "I was angry. I wanted her to have some really good lines. I wanted her to work out, even with the prime minister\’s office about what could be said," he said. "Linda told me that she would be right, that she would just have to say she couldn\’t talk about it. I said to Linda, I \’\’m not sure that\’s going to be enough\’." Reid watched the senator in parliament the day after Lisa Wilkinson\’s interview and "it was unrelenting". "Linda told me ... this was what Kimberley Kitching had told her ... this reign of terror was going to occur," he said, referring to the late Labor senator. Reid was tearful as he told the court about Senator Reynolds\’ diagnosis with cardiac issues after she was rushed to a hospital emergency ward in pain. "He said \’we might lose her\’," recounting what the cardiologist had told him. Reid said the social media targeting the senator was relentless. "It was attacking, it was vitriolic ... I would send some to Linda. I realised that was the worst thing ... it disturbed her," he said. Reid recalled the senator felt "stupid" after she learned about Higgins and her now husband David Sharaz\’s alleged plan in 2021 to promote their accusations of a political cover-up. "Here was a map of the plan to bring her down and potentially to bring Scott Morrison down and bring the government down," he said. "She thought she had been trying to do the right thing all the way along for Brittany ... not telling anyone ... until Brittany decided to speak." He said Wilkinson\’s five-hour pre-interview with Higgins "communicated the single-minded desire to destroy Linda and destroy the government ... and the hatred."',
                  'It\’s that time of summer to watch the most anticipated meteor shower of the year: the dazzling display known as the Perseids. Streams of light and color will travel across the sky while explosions of fireballs linger, leaving behind even brighter streaks than the meteor trails from the Perseids passing through the atmosphere. Visible annually from mid-July to September 1, the Perseid meteor shower is set to peak between Sunday and before dawn Monday. Up to 100 meteors are expected per hour, moving at a speed of 214,365 kilometres per hour. Bill Cooke, head of NASA\’s Meteoroid Environment Office, described the Perseids as the richest meteor shower of the year because of the bright fireballs. It\’s "the closest thing each year to a celestial fireworks display," Cooke said. Unusually bright meteors, fireballs can surpass 1 metre in diametre and are brighter than Venus — according to NASA and Cooke. Venus is one of the most luminous objects in the night sky. These fireballs are "brighter than any star or planet in the sky," said Robert Lunsford, the fireball report coordinator for the American Meteor Society. Like human-made fireworks, fireballs "tend to leave persistent streaks in the sky that will look like smoke and slowly dissipate over a few seconds after the meteor has gone," Lunsford said. This year is optimal for watching the shower because moonlight conditions will not wash out faint meteors, allowing viewers to observe both bright and dim ones, Cooke said. "Get in the entire shower this year," he said, pointing out that last year\’s moonlight conditions "kind of shut down the show" and obscured dim meteors. During the peak of the shower, the moon will be 50 per cent illuminated and will set around midnight — ideal conditions for meteor watching with dark skies contrasting with the balls of light. "There are meteor showers going all the time, but again, they\’re so weak, most people wouldn\’t even notice they\’re happening," Cooke said. (In a rare instance last month, however, observers spotted a fireball meteor in broad daylight in parts of the Northeast.) "This is your best opportunity to see these celestial fireworks, and what they tell us is exactly when we pass through certain orbits of the comet (Swift-Tuttle) that produced these meteors," Lunsford said. "And besides, it\’s kind of fun … like having another Fourth of July." In 1865, Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli discovered that the Perseids resulted from Earth passing through debris trails originally released by the comet Swift-Tuttle. The meteor shower\’s name comes from the location in the sky that it appears to originate from — what\’s called the radiant — near the constellation Perseus. The constellation can be identified with a stargazing app, which can help viewers pinpoint the shower\’s starting point. NASA\’s Cooke recommends four tips for optimal viewing. You don\’t need instruments such as a telescope or binoculars, but find the darkest sky you can without light pollution. If you can, lie flat on your back and look straight up, taking in as much sky as possible. Give your eyes 30 to 45 minutes to adapt to the dark. "Don\’t look at your cell phone, because that screen ruins your night vision, and it takes your eyes off the sky," Cooke said. Lunsford suggested bringing a comfortable chair so you can lie back and enjoy the scene, taking in as much sky in your view. Avoiding sources of light in your viewing location will allow you to see more meteors since most of them are faint, Lunsford said. Otherwise, you will only spot the brightest ones. The best time to view the shower is after midnight around 2 am, when the source of the meteors will be the highest in the northeastern sky, both experts said. "Mother Nature doesn\’t respect people\’s sleep," Cooke joked. Any sky-gazer can see the shower in the Northern Hemisphere, but "the maximum (peak) will be later so the best place to see (it) is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, Hawaii," Lunsford said. The Perseids are not visible in Antarctica because the radiant never rises in the view of the sky there, he added. Referring to John Denver\’s 1970s hit "Rocky Mountain High" with the lyrics of "I\’ve seen it rainin\’ fire in the sky," Cooke said, "He\’s talking about the Perseids. He saw them from Colorado. "So they\’re good enough to be inserted into a song (and) so that\’s good enough reason for me to go outside." Remaining meteor showers Here are upcoming meteor showers, with the dates they are expected to peak: Draconids: October 7-8 Orionids: October 21-22 Southern Taurids: November 4-5 Northern Taurids: November 11-12 Leonids: November 17-18 Geminids: December 13-14 Ursids: December 21-22 ',
                  'In a "Mission Impossible" spectacle, Tom Cruise appeared to take the Olympic flag from France all the way to California during the Olympic Games closing ceremony on Monday (AEST). The Hollywood star abseiled from the rooftop of Stade de France, before driving off with the flag on a motorbike and jumping on board a plane to California, and then eventually paragliding down with it onto the iconic Hollywood sign. With that, the status of the Summer Olympics host city was officially handed over to Los Angeles. The city will be hosting its third Olympics, following Games there in 1932 and 1984. "Los Angeles 1984 was something else! Let\’s do it again at LA28!" reads the post on the official Instagram page of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The Los Angeles Olympic Games will take place between 14 and 30 July 2028, and the countdown on the official LA28 page has already started. So, here\’s what we already know about the Los Angeles Games in 2028. Games organisers say the LA28 emblem represents "the city\’s vibrant culture of creativity, sport and self-expression". The LA28 emblem is evolving, with more than 40 different unique versions. In the emblem, the L, 2 and 8 are static, and the A is created by the US Olympic athletes, or local LA-based artists and musicians. Among the creators is the US Olympic athlete and cross-country mountain bike cyclist Kate Courtney. Her version of the A is hand-drawn and is inspired by the hand-drawn advertisements of bike races in the birthplace of mountain biking in Marin County, California. The Red Hot Chili Peppers have also created their version of a logo — "a rainbow and a cloud turned into an A", the band\’s lead singer, Anthony Kiedis, said in a Youtube interview with LA28 organisers. "Our first rec(ord) came out in 1984 along with LA Olympics. It was a very exciting time for music in LA. It was still kind of the end of the punk rock scene," said Kiedis. "And the fact that it\’s coming here again, I would definitely look to be the starting point guard for Team USA basketball." The LA28 Olympic Games will include two new sports, flag football and squash, while baseball, softball, cricket (Twenty20) and lacrosse (Sixes) will make their Olympic returns after absences of years to decades. Each proposed sport was evaluated according to IOC criteria, which include economic responsibility, gender equality, sport integrity, fan interest and youth relevance. Casey Wasserman, LA28 chairperson, said the new sports were proposed to "ignite imagination on the field of play and drive culture off it". "They\’re relevant, innovative and community-based, played in backyards, schoolyards, community centres, stadiums and parks across the U.S. and the globe," Wasserman said. "They will bring new athletes to the Games, engage diverse fanbases and expand the Games\’ presence in digital spaces, further amplifying LA28\’s mission to deliver an unparalleled experience." The LA28 organising committee is the first to add para climbing to the Paralympic sports program. In the Paralympic Games 2028, para climbing will join the 22 confirmed Paralympic sports. Breaking — commonly known as breakdancing — which debuted at this year\’s Paris Games, will not be returning for the Los Angeles Games in 2028. According to the organisers, the main goal behind selecting venues is to keep the games "fiscally responsible" by using fewer temporary venues and assigning sports to existing ones. Multiple historical venues will host Olympic sports for the second — and even third — time. The LA Memorial Coliseum will host athletics and para athletics, making it the only stadium in history to host track and field competitions in three Olympic Games. Diving will return to the same venue it was hosted at in the Los Angeles Olympic Games in 1932 — the 1932 pool in Exposition Park. Legendary Arena in Downtown LA — home to the NBA\’s Lakers, NHL\’s Kings, and WNBA\’s Sparks — will host gymnastics. The Stadium in Inglewood, with up to 38,000 seats, will be the largest swimming venue in Olympic history. Some events will be held outside Los Angeles. Canoe slalom and softball venues in Southern California can host only up to 2,000 people. Organisers have explained that instead of building new venues, they will move those sports to existing venues in Oklahoma City, more than 1,800km east of LA. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Stadium in Inglewood will host the opening and closing Ceremonies of the Los Angeles Olympics. While the torch may have been handed to Los Angeles during the closing ceremony, there\’s still plenty to get excited about before 2028. The 2024 Paralympics will run from 28 August to 8 September in Paris, marking the first time Paris has hosted the event. This year\’s Paralympic Games feature 22 sports — including archery, badminton, cycling, football, judo, paracanoe, paratriathlon, rowing, swimming, Taekwondo and wheelchair basketball. Then, in 2026, the next Winter Olympics will be held jointly in the Italian cities of Milan and Cortina d\’Ampezzo, between 6 to 22 February. The Winter Paralympics will run between 6 and 15 March.',
                  'Australia\’s social cohesion has come under strain in recent months. The buzzword has been increasingly used amid a surge in violence, riots, Islamophobia and antisemitism in Australian communities. On Monday, Mike Burgess, director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, said the war in Gaza had undermined social cohesion as he raised the country\’s terror threat level to "probable". "The conflict has fuelled grievances, promoted protests, undermined social cohesion and elevated intolerance," he said. The downturn in collective connectedness even prompted the federal cabinet to appoint Australia\’s first special envoy for social cohesion, Peter Khalil, in last week\’s cabinet reshuffle. Experts explain the concept and social cohesion\’s biggest threat. There are multiple definitions of social cohesion. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare states it is an important "determinant of well-being" indicating to what extent a society is "integrated or divided". A reference in the 1800s described it as "the absence of latent social conflict, and the presence of strong social bonds". Dr Hass Dellal is the executive director of the Australian Multicultural Foundation and chair of the federal government\’s multicultural framework review. He said the foundation of social cohesion is belonging and "embracing social good". "There\’s really no agreed definition on social cohesion, but the most current definitions are on a sense of belonging, attachment to a group, participation and shared values," Dellal told SBS News. "Belonging is a fundamental aspect of the human experience, and that\’s the foundation of social cohesion ... And with societies like ours that are so culturally diverse, to be inclusive is so important if you want to create that level of respect, but it also drives a nation to success." Gough Whitlam was the first Australian politician to use the term during his election speech in 1972. But, Dellal notes the term didn\’t grow in prominence until the 1990s due to "concerns prompted by the impact of globalisation, economic change and fears fuelled by global conflicts such as the war on terrorism". The Scanlan Foundation Research Institute has been measuring social cohesion since 2007, intending to learn more about the transition of migrants into Australian society. They identified five key domains of social cohesion: worth, social justice, acceptance, belonging, and participation. Each year they ask 90 questions to produce the Scanlon Index of Social Cohesion and conduct a series of in-depth interviews across different communities. In 2023 at least 7,500 Australians from different cultural backgrounds participated, with around 250 people completing the survey in their native language. CEO Anthea Hancocks said social cohesion was on the decline, but not at a concerning rate. Last year the overall score was 78 out of 100, a 13-point drop since an all-time high during the pandemic, a time Hancocks said people felt more supported by the government. She said measures like JobSeeker and JobKeeper increased people\’s trust in the government and gave them a "sense that the government was doing the right thing to look after people". "Now all those things have disappeared. So we are back to the same place we were pre-pandemic." While global factors like local violence since the war in Gaza can impact social cohesion, Hancocks said people\’s economic circumstances were the main contributor to declining levels."The main factor that influences social cohesion overall is people\’s sense of economic worth," she said. "So whether or not they feel like they can be optimistic about their own economic futures, and that tends to underpin a whole lot of other things that people have reactions to." In light of any hardships, Australians\’ attitudes towards multiculturalism remain positive. Hancocks said their metric views this consistently as "85 per cent of the population believe multiculturalism has been good for Australia". She said engagement at a local level fostered positive feelings of social cohesion. "Australia is an incredibly cohesive country ... People have a very strong sense of comfort, familiarity, safety, and that they have multiple friends from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds," she said. Dellal credits the country\’s social policies with why multiculturalism has not failed in Australia, unlike other parts of the world. "You can\’t claim to be a successful multicultural nation simply because you\’re ethnically diverse, and in the absence of good policy … You just can\’t be diverse and just leave it at that," he said.',
                  'Terminally-ill Australians opting to end their lives using voluntary assisted dying still make up a small sliver of total deaths, yet growing demand has prompted calls to streamline the process and bolster the workforce. In a landmark Go Gentle Australia report into voluntary assisted dying — now legal in every jurisdiction except the Northern Territory — 2,460 people were found to have opted to end their lives with the service. In 2017, Victoria became the first state to legalise voluntary assisted dying, intended for those with a terminal illness suffering immense pain and wanting control over the circumstances of their death. Chief executive officer of the charity, Linda Swan said the evidence painted a "reassuring picture of systems fulfilling their aim" with health professionals providing "kind and meticulous" support. "None of the dire predictions from opponents have come to pass and systems are working safely and with great compassion," she said. The typical applicant was in their 70s with a terminal cancer diagnosis and were slightly more likely to be male, the report found. Applicants were usually well-educated, English speakers, and four in five were receiving palliative care. Applicants were three times more likely to die at home. While voluntary assisted dying only made up somewhere between 0.5 per cent and 1.6 per cent in total deaths, demand was growing and there were still a number of barriers to access. While a "person-directed" process, Swan said it was not clear if there was the right balance between safeguards and accessibility. "Gag clauses" in South Australia and Victoria, which prevent health professionals from raising the option with patients, meant many did not know about the option. "No other health care requires patients to know their treatment options before consulting a doctor," Swan said. More health professionals needed to be encouraged to complete the voluntary assisted dying training, with the report recommending they be fairly compensated. Seventeen health bodies, including the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia and the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, were calling for reform to the Commonwealth Criminal Code so people could use phone, email and telehealth as part of the process. Existing rules force applicants to attend all appointments in person, which is particularly burdensome for those living in regional or remote areas.']
